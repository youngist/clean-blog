==========

A sharper, more long-form journalism focused blog theme for {Young}ist.

_{Young}ist is your source for youth-led, fiercely independent political and cultural news, anaylsis, storytelling, and creative intervention by and for Millenials-in-action._

The organization began posting on tumblr: [http://youngist.tumblr.com/](http://youngist.tumblr.com/) but had a vision for a larger, creative and custom site. We've moved operations entirely to Github and work with an entirely open-source stack.

**Web Development:** [Maya Richman](https://github.com/mayarichman)
**Initial Design and Brand Development:** Tom Acker

The site is hosted on Digital Ocean servers webhooked using a customized script forked from Development Seed's [jekyll-hook](https://github.com/developmentseed/jekyll-hook) to this Github repo.

Responsive CSS came from [samanpwbb's starter](https://github.com/samanpwbb/fresh-start).
