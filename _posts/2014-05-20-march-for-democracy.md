The California March for Democracy, a campaign of 99Rise, will be a nonviolent campaign to elevate and dramatize the corruption of money-in-politics and activate greater public support for the fight for political equality.

On March 17th, we rallied in Los Angeles and launch a 37-day, 480-mile march to the state capitol of Sacramento to demand that California's leaders publicly acknowledge the crisis of corruption and take immediate action to end it.

As a first step, we will demand that the state legislature issue a first-in-the-nation call for an Article V Convention – by passing Assembly Joint Resolution 1 – for the sole purpose of producing a Constitutional Amendment to “get money out” and guarantee political equality. If our demand has not been met by our arrival on June 22nd, we will nonviolently occupy the Capitol until it is. We aim to have won sufficient concessions to claim victory and end the occupation by the start of summer legislative recess on July 4th.

Those who can’t join us in California will have the opportunity to plug in to the campaign through a series of web-based trainings followed by days of synchronized supporter-led actions and events.
