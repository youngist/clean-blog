<p><strong><em>“You just sit at your typewriter until little drops of blood appear on your forehead.”</em> <em>- Red Smith</em></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-23250358" target="_blank">runaway train</a> and subsequent explosion that destroyed much of the historic downtown of Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, happened at 1:30 a.m. last Saturday. Many of the large dailies in Canada had already finished laying out and printing their weekend editions for Saturday morning. In the pages of the print editions of many papers for sale throughout the weekend, Lac-Mégantic was still a quaint tourist destination in the Eastern Townships.</p>
<p>For these papers, the next print editions would not roll off the presses until a full 48 hours after a train carrying crude oil hurtled into the centre of the small town at breakneck speed, erupting into a “vision of the apocalypse,” as one resident described the flames illuminating the night.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s <em>Toronto Star</em> came wrapped in an advertisement for the Ford motor company. The ad covered the entire back page of the paper and wrapped around to cover half of the front page, hiding a photo of two young Lac-Mégantic residents weeping for a missing friend, whom they feared dead. <!-- more --></p>
<p>In the <em>Montreal Gazette</em>, page A5 featured a three-quarter-page ad inviting readers to “Trade in, Trade Up” at their local Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge/Ram dealership. The ad in the <em>Gazette,</em> which trumpeted the fuel efficiency of the cars, sat beneath a selection of quotes from residents and commentators about the tragedy in Lac-Mégantic. One of them was from Bob Schultz, a business professor in Calgary. “I&#8217;m not sure this is the tipping point yet,” he said from the city built on oil money. “We probably need to see a barge sink in the Mississippi River or a major derailment in British Columbia before people really change their minds about moving oil by rail,” he told the<em> Gazette</em>, his words hanging over the ad&#8217;s picture of a shiny blue 2013 model Dodge Journey.</p>
<p>The <em>Gazette</em> did not print Schultz&#8217;s explanation, if he offered one, of how big a derailment would have to be to qualify as “major&#8221;, why Lac-Mégantic didn&#8217;t qualify, or why such a “major derailment” would have to occur in British Columbia rather than in Quebec.</p>
<p>The <em>Gazette</em>'s headline on Monday, in block capitals, on page A1 was: “How did this happen to Lac-Mégantic?” over a helicopter picture of the burnt out rubble of what used to be downtown. Possibly to prepare readers for the horrific anguish in the pages beyond, the front page of the same edition of the <em>Gazette</em> offered – as the “Quote of the Day” – poet John Donne&#8217;s classic refrain: “No man is an island; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.”</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>The above description of the grim irony of newspaper layouts is not a knock on the work produced by their journalists. They have done excellent work in difficult conditions. I joked with a reporter about the twisted modernity of filing stories from the seat of a powerful, spacious Chrysler 300 rental. (Sometimes only black humour will do for those of us trying to put order to these events. It&#8217;s not as easy for those who live in Lac-Mégantic.)</p>
<p>The ads in the newspapers just served as reminders that our ability to relate the horrors of Lac-Mégantic is, in some way, paid for by the same oil and gas economy that brought hell to this lakeside town. In oil-producing areas in the global south, like the Niger River Delta or the oil-rich sands of Iraq, many nights are illuminated by gunfire, by explosions. Countries have been invaded and coups have been executed – whether by the Shell company, or the United States military – to secure this stuff.</p>
<p>I drove to Lac-Mégantic in a car. I took a large coach bus home to Montreal, using onboard wifi to follow the news from the town I had just left. All these moments involve steps in the chain of production in some way, from extraction to market to consumption: oil out of the ground in North Dakota or Alberta, across the continent through Lac-Mégantic to be (most days, before Saturday) refined in New Brunswick, before being pumped into our cars and then finally, into the air and into our lungs.</p>
<p>If only the explosion had been more “major”, you know, in British Columbia or on the Mississippi River, then maybe all of  these connections – and their impact on all our lives – might have reached the “tipping point” for Calgary business professors.</p>
