bio: "Cayden Mak is 26 years-old. They are the social media wizard for 18 Million Rising. They are finishing up a Master of Fine Arts in digital media at the University at Buffalo, New York, where they study participatory archives and games for civic engagement. Before joining 18MR, they worked as a staff organizer for SUNY’s Graduate Student Employees Union, and have been deeply involved with New York Students Rising. Though they were born and raised in southeast Michigan, they’re more likely to say they come from the internet.
