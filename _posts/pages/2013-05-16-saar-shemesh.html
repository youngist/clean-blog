bio: "Saar Shemesh, 21, is an artist; born, raised, living, working and studying in New York City. She is currently in her first year at Cooper Union, where she studies “fine art.” Before Cooper, she was a student at CUNY Brooklyn College for two years, where she met and worked extensively with her radical peers in the Brooklyn College Student Union to fight for student/adjunct rights, and against tuition hikes. She often has her hands in many different sorts of projects, and is always looking for more to pile on her plate. She doesn’t do social media very well, so you can’t follow her on twitter."
