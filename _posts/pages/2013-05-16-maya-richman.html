bio: "Maya means illusion in Sanskrit but she has a tangible form that currently resides in Montreal, originally hailing from Venice, California. Stumbling and scraping her knees on a computer science minor while studying international development, she found herself programming, embracing open source, Github and digital storytelling. She built custom map-based websites with <a href='http://www.mapbox.com/'>Mapbox</a> and the American Red Cross and dabbles in graphic design, video editing, and improvisational electronic music performance. You can send her sparkly gifs at <a href='https://twitter.com/mayarichman'>@mayarichman</a>."
