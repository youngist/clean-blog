bio: "Luz Rodea, born and bred in Mexico City, has lived most of her life in that chaotic place and it is out of that love for diversity and chaos where her interests are born: from art, design, photography and urbanism to astrophysics and neurobiology. Oddly enough, she ended up studying Political Science in the National University and she’s currently preparing a Sociology (Gender, Politics and Sexuality) masters in Paris. She’s worked with Sexual and Reproductive Rights NGOs, including the (Mexico City) Women’s Institute, and is currently a freelance political consultant and analyst (specializing in gender politics and development), translating/subtitling films and documentaries for the National Film Archive, and beginning her path in journalism (recently serving as a professor at the 2013 School of Authentic Journalism). She hopes to be brave enough to try her skills in photojournalism soon, or maybe astrophysics. Follow her @luz_rodeas."
