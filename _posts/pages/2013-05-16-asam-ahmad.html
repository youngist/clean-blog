bio: "Asam Ahmad is a multidisciplinary writer, poet, scholar and community organizer. He is a writer who still has a hard time trusting words. Hailing from Faisalabad via London via Montreal, he is now a writer based in Toronto (with a short stint in Chenab Nagar). He has been actively involved in student, queer and social justice movements locally and nationally for the past 10 years. He is currently coordinating the Youth Program at the Metropolitan Action Committee for the Prevention of Violence Against Women & Children, and is a co-founder of the It Gets Fatter Project, a body-positivity project for fat people of color. His writing on social justice and Islamophobia have appeared in Shameless Magazine, Now Magazine, Black Girl Dangerous and a peer review journal at John Hopkins University. He is a tumblr, dim sum and reading addict, an armchair film critic, and is passionate about making the world a fatter place."
