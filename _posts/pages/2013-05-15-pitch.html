<p class='margin1 col6 white'>Youngist is always looking for fresh perspectives, new ideas, and different ways to support our grassroots, innovative youth culture.</p>
<p class='margin1 col6 white'>We want to know how you experience and explore art, we want your savvy commentary on popular culture, current events, intersectional oppressions -- and most importantly, we want to support ourselves and each other. For some outstanding examples of published pieces that demonstrate on-point youth analysis on pop culture and politics, reflective narratives on Millennial identity and struggle, and introspective angles on youth and/or student organizing for social justice, please click <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/about#what'>here</a> to get an idea on the content we are looking for.</p> 
<h3 class='margin5 col6'>Contact our editorial team <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/about#contact'>here</a> to pitch any ideas to participate in our horizontal, collaborative editing process.</h3>
