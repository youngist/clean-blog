<h3>Have A Pitch?</h3>
<p>Youngist is always looking for fresh perspectives, new ideas, and different ways to support our grassroots, innovative youth culture. We want to know how you experience and explore art, we want your savvy commentary on popular culture, current events, intersectional oppressions -- and most importantly, we want to support ourselves and each other. Please contact our editorial team HERE (HYPERLINK) to pitch any ideas to participate in our horizontal, collaborative editing process.</p>
