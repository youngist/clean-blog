	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>In the past year since {Young}ist launched, we’ve published nearly 300 stories by young people across the globe, and the enthusiastic response has blown all of us away. We’ve grown to upwards of 18,000 readers/month, and our stories have been picked up by everyone from TruthOut and The Nation, to The Daily Beast and Cosmo. Readers can tell we’re different; our contributors are not just writing about movements, they’re helping lead them.</p>
	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>We’ve been bootstrapping it, but we also take pride in paying our contributors for their hard work, sometimes the first paid writing gig they’ve ever had. Just as {Young}ist provides a vital answer to Millennial-bashing in mainstream media narrative, such modest compensation is vital in a mediascape where young writers’ labor is routinely exploited.</p>
	<h2 class='margin1 col9'>But because {Young}ist has grown faster than we could ever have hoped, we need your support now more than ever.</h2>
	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>We know that budgets are tight, but if you’ve read, and loved,  a {Young}ist story this year, consider chipping in as a thank-you for a job well done, or an investment in expanding this great content’s reach.</p>
