	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>In the past year since Youngist launched, we’ve published nearly 300 stories by young people across the globe, and the enthusiastic response has blown all of us away. We’ve grown to upwards of 18,000 readers/month, and our stories have been picked up by everyone from TruthOut and The Nation, to The Daily Beast and Cosmo. Readers can tell we’re different; our contributors are not just writing about movements, they’re helping lead them.</p>
	<h2 class='margin1 col9'>Youngist exists thanks to money from people who believed in us, people like you, and we wish to continue bringing you content that inspires.</h2>
	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>We’ve been bootstrapping it, but we also take pride in paying our contributors for their hard work, sometimes the first paid writing gig they’ve ever had. Just as Youngist provides a vital answer to Millennial-bashing in mainstream media narrative, such modest compensation is vital in a mediascape where young writers’ labor is routinely exploited.</p>
	<h2 class='margin1 col9'>But because Youngist has grown faster than we could ever have hoped, we’re also running out of money for our writers faster than we ever anticipated.</h2>
	<p class='margin1 col9 donate-p'>We know that budgets are tight, but if you’ve read, and loved, a Youngist story this year – consider chipping in as a thank-you for a job well done, or an investment in expanding this great content’s reach.</p>
