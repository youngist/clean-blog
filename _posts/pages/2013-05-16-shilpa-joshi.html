bio: "Shilpa Joshi, 25, is a youth environmental organizer working in Maryland and DC for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. While completing her undergrad at American University, Shilpa strived to make the school’s environmental group, Eco-Sense, the most hardworking and effective on campus. Students pushed and won campaigns to make the school’s energy 100% offset by wind credits, have the shuttle bus system run on biodiesel, and overhaul the school’s purchasing policy. After AU, Shilpa went on to work at the Alliance for Climate Education, the Capital Fringe Festival, and the best pizza restaurant in the country, 2 Amy’s. She likes to think (and write) about environmental justice, being queer and Indian-American, and food."
