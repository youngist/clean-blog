bio: "Ngoc Loan Tran currently resides in Charlotte, NC by way of Sài Gòn, Việt Nam. A writer, storyteller and organizer, they center their energy and vision for liberation on migrant justice and an end to interpersonal violence by living at the intersections of multiple oppressions and privileges. In their work, they are committed to keeping the political personal because bell hooks tell us, “without justice there can be no love.” Loan is particularly excited about this project because as a queer southerner of color, daily their work allows them to fulfill the legacy of young people who have been at the core of every social movement and they believe the resilience of young people is transformative, creative, and worth documenting."
