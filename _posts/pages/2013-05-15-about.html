    <h5 class='topborder bottomborder margin1 col9 about-category'>What We Do</h5>
    <h2 class='margin1 col9'>{Young}ist was born in response to the scapegoating of our generation in mainstream, corporate media narratives.</h2>
    <h2 class='margin1 col9'>As we are burdened with the economic crisis, a broken immigration system, and the rampant violence on young Black, Brown, queer, and transgender youth across the globe - we pursue storytelling not only as a vehicle to spread news, but also as a vital organizing tool to combating oppression. We see youth-led publishing and cross-pollination of ideas and strategies as a political necessity in this digital age.

        <li> WWe spawn change by creating a dynamic online community organized by us and for us.</li>

        <li> We are accountable to our extended community of artists and organizers, while still maintaining our autonomy.</li>
        <li> We strive in both content and conduct to interrogate and dismantle systems of privilege, power, and oppression in society at large; {Young}ist strives to highlight and amplify the stories and voices of frontline communities left out of prevailing movement narratives.</li>
        <li> We value the privacy of our users, and will allow neither government nor corporations to access user information.</li>
