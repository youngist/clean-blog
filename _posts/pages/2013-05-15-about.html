            <li>1. Foster collaboration between artists and activists through sharing our ideas, images, and stories about culture and politics.</li>
            <li>2. Challenge the belief that young artists and activists’ efforts are at odds with one another by putting forward our own accounts of the issues impacting our communities</li>
            <li>3. Develop a youth-powered mediascape by building an online network of young people leading innovative projects to transform the way we produce and consume media</li>

    <p class='margin1 about-list col9'>
        <ol class='margin1 col9' style='font-size:20px; color:#474546;'>
        <li>1. We nurture change by providing a dynamic online space that’s run by us and for us</li>
        <li>2. We reject any influence of advertisers or big donors, and make all decisions regarding {young}ist content and design according to principles of participatory self-management</li>
        <li>3. We are accountable to our extended community of artists and organizers, while still maintaining our autonomy.</li>
        <li>4. We strive in both content and conduct to interrogate and dismantle systems of privilege, power, and oppression in society at large; {young}ist strives to highlight and amplify the stories and voices of frontline communities left out of prevailing movement narratives.</li>
        <li>5. We value the privacy of our users, and will allow neither government nor corporations to access user information.</li>
