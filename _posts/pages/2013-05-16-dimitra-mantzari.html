bio: "Dimitra Mantzari is 23 years old and grew up on the Greek island of Lesvos, in the north-east corner of the Aegean Sea. She acquired a degree in Psychology from Panteion University in Athens but in the meantime occupied herself with several other things. Besides learning to be a Spanish and German speaker, she tries to discover her artistic tendencies from time to time, whether its guitar playing or swing dancing. She is a member of the left-wing political youth of SYRIZA and you will find her most often passionately participating in discussions about gender equality or mental health issues. Her work with people in mental health services towards psychosocial recovery in the community has given her a deep appreciation of the stories and the potential each person carries inside them. Real-world problems aside, she is equally concerned with other worlds, galaxies far far away, mountains of doom, winter castles and epic quests."
