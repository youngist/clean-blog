bio: "Alice Lesperance is a 23 year old post-grad English major with an equally unemployable Religion minor. You can find her on tumblr as shakespeareandpunk, where she blogs about punk culture, music, and whatever TV show sheâ€™s currently devouring. She's also the co-creator of the ever-expanding Millennial Gospel project on tumblr, exploring the cross-section of religion, politics, and millennial culture."
