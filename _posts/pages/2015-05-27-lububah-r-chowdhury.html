bio: "I graduated from an institution of higher education where I loved my subject and my professors and had a tempestuous relationship with my administration. For some reason, I'm looking at going back to school in the fall. Beats me! I was part of Students for Justice in Palestine and worked closely with Black Students United and Movimiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztl√°n. I write about racism, classism and sexism in our society and the ways in which individuals can make life-affirming choices to resist the oppression of the white-cis-hetero-capitalist-patriarchy. Oh, and I am writing a fantasy novel for teenage girls. So there's that."
