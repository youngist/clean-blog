bio: "Teagan Widmer is a 24 year old, white, queer, trans woman from the bay area. She is a writer, artist, activist, and community organizer. She currently holds an MFA in Theatre Pedagogy from Virginia Commonwealth University and a BA in English Literature from Pacific Union College. She thinks and writes about gender (specifically being trans), the performing arts, and pop culture. She has lectured and presented her work for colleges and events around the United States. She likes to imagine that in her future she will sit reading a good book next to a roaring fire in a large den with lots of bookshelves while her partner and their numerous animals curl up next to her."
