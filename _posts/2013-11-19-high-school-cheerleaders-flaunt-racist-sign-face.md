<p><span>In McCalla, Ala., the McAdory High School cheerleading team thought it was a good idea to construct a bust-thru sign (pictured above) that read, in big rainbow lettering: “Hey Indians, get ready to leave in a Trail of Tears Round 2.″</span></p>
<p>The sign&nbsp;insensitively refers to the violent relocation of Cherokee, Muscogee (Creek), Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw peoples from their lands in 1831 as a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act" target="_blank">Indian Removal Act of 1830</a>. The cheerleading team claims that the sign was designed to taunt their school’s opposing football team, the Pinson Valley High School “Indians.”</p>

<p><span>The administration of McAdory High School was quick to </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131119090016/http://mcadoryhigh.jefcoed.com/" target="_blank"><span>denounce</span></a><span> the actions of their school’s cheerleaders without taking any responsibility for the learning environment they created. Principal Tod Humphries released his own statement that closed with a formal apology to Native communities, “Please accept our sincere apologies to the Native American people and to anyone who was offended by the reference to an event that is a stain on our nation’s past forever.”<!-- more --></span></p>
<p><span>Humphries also claims to be taking steps to re-educate McAdory students about the Trail of Tears. “All social studies and history teachers will re-teach and/or review units concerning Native American displacement following the Indian Removal Act of 1830,” he wrote.</span></p>

<p><span>The superintendent for the school district, Dr. Stephen Nowlin, quickly followed with a letter directed to the surrounding community regarding the punishment the cheerleading team will face, as well as a public apology for its actions. “I want to personally apologize for this very sad incident which should never have happened,” Nez Calhoun, the school district’s director of public information, told&nbsp;</span><a href="http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/inappropriate-trail-tears-sign-brings-discipline-cheerleading-squad/" target="_blank"><span>Native News</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>“We can use this unfortunate event as an important teachable moment,” wrote Superintendent Nowlin in his own message on the <a href="http://www.jefcoed.com/" target="_blank">county school board website</a>.</p>
<p><span>Here’s a tip, Nowlin </span><span>et al.</span><span>: don’t refer to instances of racism against Native peoples as a “teachable moment.” Take some responsibility for the fact that you are at least partially responsible for the creation of that bust-thru sign – and most importantly, the thinking behind it.</span></p>
