“We came here to Palestine to stand in love and revolutionary struggle with our brothers and sisters,” journalist and scholar Marc Lamont Hill declared to kick off a solidarity demonstration in Nazareth last week. 

Hill was one in a coalition of Black freedom fighters from organizations including the [Dream Defenders](http://dreamdefenders.org/vest/), [New York Justice League](http://www.gatheringforjustice.org/justice_league_nyc), [#BlackLivesMatter](http://thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/), [Black Youth Project 100](http://www.blackyouthproject.com/), and [Ferguson/Hands Up United](http://www.handsupunited.org/) who traveled to Palestine this month for a 10-day visit to meet and support Palestinians working to resist Israeli occupation.

Parallels between the [struggles of Palestinians and Black Americans](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/rana-baker/palestinians-express-solidarity-people-ferguson-mike-brown-statement) has been a topic raised in demonstrations around the world, including connections made between policing styles used to suppress protests and the weapons deployed against the protestors.

Solidarity between the two struggles also has a long history: Abuznaid cited the legacies of Malcolm X and Angela Davis [in a piece about the trip](http://www.ebony.com/news-views/dream-defenders-black-lives-matter-ferguson-reps-take-historic-trip-to-palestine#axzz3P9b8EXbO) in Ebony. And just two months ago, delegates at #SquadUp14, the Dream Defenders conference, unanimously voted to support the [Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement](http://www.bdsmovement.net/).

The American coalition [experienced Israeli apartheid firsthand](https://medium.com/ummah-wide/can-we-dream-together-palestine-f6b5c6d5fb15), met displaced families, visited a refugee camp, and accompanied Dream Defenders' Legal & Policy Director, Ahmad Abuznaid, as he crossed an Israeli Checkpoint in order to visit his birthplace of Jerusalem. 

The group decided to hold a solidarity demonstration in Nazareth, which is documented in the video below. Participants wore both keffiyahs and hoodies, chanted in English and Arabic, and declared their solidarity with each other.
