On July 16th, four Palestinian boys aged 9-12 from the Bakr family, were playing soccer on a Gazan beach. In one moment they were escaping the horrific reality of experiencing the fourth, fifth, or sixth war in their lives by kicking around a soccer ball. The next moment an Israeli missile [bombed them](http://online.wsj.com/articles/palestinians-mourn-four-boys-killed-on-gaza-beach-by-israel-missiles-1405616076) and robbed them of their breath and bodies. Israel claimed they “mistook” them for terrorists. Nevertheless, Israel has illegally reintroduced [chemical weapons](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/12881-medical-sources-israel-using-unfamiliar-toxic-gas-against-palestinians-in-gaza) and [lethal flechett shell darts](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/20/israel-using-flechette-shells-in-gaza) into its arsenal, and has committed a Sabra/Shatila-esque massacre in the [town of Shujaiya](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/massacre-shujaiya-dozens-killed-israel-shells-eastern-gaza-city-photos) with almost 100 Palestinian lives [stolen](http://www.thenation.com/article/180728/massacre-shejaiya) from one sunrise to the next. Once again, Israel is proving to show no mercy for innocent and precious Palestinian human life.


*Palestinian Mobilization*

In situations of occupier vs. occupied we must firstly affirm the right of the occupied to resist. The question of violence vs. non-violence is not an absolute binary, but a choice of strategy. Even if we look through the (colonial) lens of international law, as an occupying power, Israel still does not legally have the right to [self-defense](http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/8799/no-israel-does-not-have-the-right-to-self-defense-). The democratically elected Hamas-centric government along with other resistance organizations have responded to Israel’s attempted [annihilation](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/expel-palestinians-populate-gaza-jews-says-knesset-deputy-speaker) of the Palestinian people of Gaza by firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, and combating the ground invasion. Armed struggled is not only justified by [UN Resolution 3070](http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/439B978DA862DB9C85256CDA005CB3E3), but must work to disrupt and shock the [moral conscience](https://opendemocracy.net/arab-awakening/rana-baker/rejecting-victimhood-case-for-palestinian-resistance) of its Zionist colonial occupier. Palestinians in Gaza have fought fearlessly against Israel’s superior military; which includes armored tanks bulldozers, Apache helicopters, F16s, naval warships, and don’t forget, nuclear weapons- all of which Gaza lacks. The amount of Israelis who have died in the past two weeks is [thirty-five](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/health-facilities-hit-israels-gaza-attacks-death-toll-rises-over-640-129158985), consisting mainly of occupying forces in combat, compared to a majority-civilian death toll for Palestinians.

While the Palestinians in occupied Gaza have mobilized against Israel’s onslaught, we must also recognize that Palestinians and their allies (including Israeli-Jews and internationals) in the occupied territory of the West Bank and Palestine ’48 have also been sweating blood and tears to protest and take action towards justice. There have been thousands in the streets of [Haifa](http://www.timesofisrael.com/arab-israelis-in-haifa-protest-gaza-offensive/_; Palestinians [cutting off power](https://www.facebook.com/SavePalestinefromtheIsraelioccupation/posts/10152578096395421) to settler-colonies in the West Bank; and Israeli-Jews protesting in [Tel-Aviv](http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/Hundreds-gather-to-protest-Gaza-offensive-in-central-Tel-Aviv-and-Haifa-363484) and [Jerusalem](http://countercurrentnews.com/2014/07/pro-peace-protests-are-sweeping-israel-right-now-and-israeli-jdl-fascists-are-freaking-out/) against the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians (including a [petition](http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/stop-israeli-apartheid-boycott-embargo-and-indictments-now-%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%9D-%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95-%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%A7-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A2%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%95) by Israeli citizens supporting the BDS movement). The 27th day of Ramadan, known as Laylat Al-Qadr (the Night of Power), lived up to its name, with over 10,000 Palestinians marching across the West Bank towards Al-Quds (Jerusalem) in what has been described as the largest protest in [decades](http://972mag.com/the-largest-west-bank-protest-in-decades/94280/). It is reported that calls for a Third Intifada uprising have been made as well.


*Transnational Mobilizing*

In an effort to flip our maps upside down, let us start the analysis of transnational solidarity from the global south. The following list gives us an idea, although not an exhaustive one, of where global south solidarity mobilizations have been taking place: Chile, Ecuador, Turkey, Venezuela, Brasil, Iran, Yemen, Morocco, Jordan, Argentina, China, Taiwan, Lebanon, Mauritius, South Africa, India, and South Korea. Highlights include organizations like [BDS South Africa](https://www.facebook.com/bdssouthafrica) working to line the streets of Cape Town with 40,000 people (the biggest street protest since South Africans protested against their own Apartheid), in addition to an extensive campaign to get the Israeli Ambassador to South Africa expelled (which has received support by the ruling ANC party). Chile has [suspended](http://www.worldbulletin.net/world/140840/chile-to-suspend-trade-talks-with-israel-over-gaza-bombing) its Free Trade Agreement with Israel and is considering recalling its ambassador in Tel-Aviv. Ecuador has [recalled](http://www.imemc.org/article/68570) its ambassador to Israel. Brasil has [recalled](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.606979) its ambassador to Israel. Protestors in Turkey [bombarded](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israelgaza-conflict-turkish-protesters-raise-palestinian-flag-outside-israeli-consulate-in-istanbul-9614041.html) the Israeli embassy and replaced the Israeli flag with the Palestinian one. From Delhi to [Mumbai](http://www.irna.ir/en/News/81237734/Politic/India_witnesses_massive_protests_against_Israeli_attack_on_Gaza__Report), activists in India are staging large protests outside of Israeli embassy/consulates, including a protest in Kashmir in which a Palestine solidarity activist was [martyred](http://www.thekashmirwalla.com/2014/07/gaza-protests-youth-shot-dead-in-kashmir/) by state security forces.

In the global north massive mobilizations have taken place across Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. In London over 100,000 protestors have [flooded](http://www.channel4.com/news/gaza-protests-thousands-attend-pro-palestinian-london-demo) the street in the past two weeks, including a [unique campaign](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/amena-saleem/protesters-force-bbc-confront-its-pro-israel-bias) to force the BBC to recognize its pro-Israel biased media coverage of the war on Gaza. Palestine solidarity activists in Ireland gained a victory when the Dublin city council called for an [arms embargo and trade sanctions](http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/dublin-city-council-calls-israel-sanctions) against Israel. Sweden [refused](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/11451-sweden-refuses-israeli-presidents-plane-entry-into-its-airspace) the Israeli president’s plane entry into its airspace. On the flip side, the socialist-led French government regressively responded to 30,000 people in the streets by implementing a [ban on pro-Palestine](http://rt.com/news/173412-france-palestinian-israel-protest/) protests. Activists responded with a broad based coalition of mainly Arab, Muslim, and Black French citizens [marching](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/7/19/paris-gaza-police.html) 5,000 strong only two days later, provoking a scene reminiscent of the 1960s when our communities latched arms during decolonial struggles.

In the United States, mobilizations have picked up increasing steam across most of the country. In Los Angeles coalitions of students, NGOs, and community organizations have pulled several thousand out for rallies in front of the Israeli consulate and federal government building, even as an officer from the department of [Homeland Security shot](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-israel-gaza-protest-federal-agent-20140714-story.html) at pro-Palestine supporters. Protestors in Chicago lined the streets in the [tens of thousands](http://www.fightbacknews.org/2014/7/20/10000-fill-streets-chicago-protesting-israel-s-assault-gaza) in addition to demonstrating outside of Boeing for the company’s complicity in the occupation, with 5 activists [being arrested](http://abc7chicago.com/news/5-arrested-at-boeing-headquarters-protest-amid-gaza-conflict/193188/). From Boston to New York City, masses of civil society organizations, student groups, faith-based organizations, and everyday people have been repeatedly beating their chests, praying, waving their flags, and chanting at the American general public to wake the hell up and end its special relationship with Israel. At the heart of the Empire itself, organizers in DC mobilized a die-in in front of the White House to inform Obama that this is not a complicated issue; his administration must work towards scrubbing the blood off its hands by doing something it has never honestly done: recognize that Palestinian life matters.


*Why BDS Must Strike Back at the Empire*

In light of decades of the failed “peace process” (including the complicity of the Palestinian leadership in the occupation), as well as the recent brilliant display of transnational solidarity for Palestine, the dire situation in Gaza exceedingly demonstrates the urgent need to support the global [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)](http://www.bdsmovement.net/bdsintro) movement against Israel. In a similar manner to the way the international community worked in solidarity with the peoples of South Africa to aid in ending apartheid, BDS is a Palestinian civil society-led initiative which calls on the peoples of the world to aid us in ending the military occupation, system of apartheid, and ensuring the right of return to our homeland.

The United States is a crucial battle zone for BDS. The U.S. government supplying over [$3 billion a year](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) to Israel should not only cause a foul taste in our mouths, but must fire us towards action. The absolute chokehold of the anti-Palestinian Zionist lobby on congress, the mainstream media, and other systems of power in the Empire is [loosening](http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/israel-alienating-mainstream.html). While there been have an increasing amount of [victories](http://www.bdsmovement.net/victories) for BDS globally and in the U.S., our analysis of transnational mobilization for Gaza proves that activists in the United States must learn from others, particularly those in the global south, who are making the necessary strides towards answering the calls of BDS. We must demand more from ourselves, and ask the necessary question- how can we do radically better?

For those of us located in the U.S. we must manipulate our privilege towards the radically better. Let us use our people power to continue forming multi-pronged approaches. When will we increase the demand that the Israeli consulate generals and ambassadors be expelled (as a form of diplomatic protest)? How can we increase the pressure to end U.S. economic/military ties with Israel? Or start campaigns calling on the U.S. government/United Nations to prosecute American and European citizens who commit acts of terrorism by fighting [jihad]()http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/07/jihad-israel-201472272438651885.html for Israel? How can we better support the academic boycott (and its rising amount of victories)? Where does the cultural boycott fit in most strategically? Where do we build stronger movement relations with Palestine solidarity organizations on a transnational scale (borderless solidarity is always dangerous)? Is it actually possible to create a lived community in the U.S. that doesn’t systematically oppress Palestinian life in any way (and better yet, works with others to dismantle all forms of oppression)? The answers to these questions will differ in relation to location and context. But how can we continue to ask smarter questions and offer more strategic answers?

We must up the ante on the grassroots level by furthering divestment campaigns at our [universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_Israel), places of worship (and not just churches!), and from [multinational companies](https://wedivest.org/companies) complicit in the loss of Palestinian land and life. We must find new creative ways of showing the world that, as the Palestinian writer-activist [Ali Abunimah](http://www.haymarketbooks.org/pb/The-Battle-for-Justice-in-Palestine) has said, “The battle for justice in Palestine is not about a one or two solution. It is about decolonization.” The former has put power in the hands of corrupt state and corporate interests, while the latter centers justice through the will of the people (even if we must manipulate state/corporate power towards the radically better). How can a [decolonial framework](http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VII%202/Grosfoguel-FM.pdf) help us to re-center liberation, while courageously digging deeper into our self-autonomizing and collectively creative potential?

In realizing the intersectionality of our struggle/s, we must also work diligently with our allies knowing that abolishing the prison-industrial complex in Palestine means dismantling the [same systems](http://waronwant.org/component/content/article/18046) that imprisons Brown and Black bodies in the U.S. It means that our mobilizations to tear down the 30-meter high apartheid wall in Palestine, also aids in [tearing down](http://mondoweiss.net/2010/05/the-palestine-mexico-border.html) the increasingly militarized apartheid border between the U.S. and Mexico. And it further demonstrates that de-masculinizing, de-militarizing and decolonizing Palestine/Israel has similar implications for social justice movements in the U.S. and elsewhere. Our peoples must reimagine ourselves not as some type of ragtag “minority” collective (we have never been the minority, we have been minoritized). We must seek to use our majority power for militantly proliferating new worlds of love, justice, knowledge, and community.


*Flipping the Question: Where do you stand?*  

In the case of the current Israel-led war on the Palestinians of the Gaza strip, critically conscious global citizens must ask the urgent question- whose power do you choose to support? The power of more than a century of racist Zionist Israeli colonization and occupation of Palestinian land and life? Or the power of an indigenous Palestinian people to resist an apartheid system of settler-colonialism and military occupation? Does one support the power of settler-only roads on illegally occupied Palestinian homes and farms? Or the power of Palestinians growing thousand-year old olive trees in spite of settlers continuously burning them down? Do we support the power of day-to-day airstrikes and bombings on Gaza? Or the power of Palestinians fighting for our liberation and right of return, who call on the international community to aid us in our struggle?

Palestinians call on the global community to join us in our cause to end Israel’s cycle of death, by promoting a system that recreates life. A system which ultimately seeks to liberate not only the lives of Palestinians, but those of our occupiers as well.
