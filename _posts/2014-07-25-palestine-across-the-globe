Palestinians teach life. Indeed, we do. The Palestinian poet Rafeef Ziadeh famously wrote the poem [“We Teach Life, Sir”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKucPh9xHtM) to demonstrate what it means for an occupied peoples to live under a system which superiorizes one human population over another. The same poetic language cannot be used to describe Apartheid Israel.

The political ideology of Zionism, which fuels Apartheid Israel, is a historical force that superiorizes the life of the Jew over the non-Jew. More precisely, it puts the life of the White European Jew at the top of its racist death hierarchy, while the personhood of the indigenous Palestinian idles at the bottom. And recently the livelihood of the African migrant/refugee population in Israel has [joined the bottom ranks](http://www.davidsheen.com/racism/), with Israel increasingly becoming an anti-Palestinian and anti-Black society.

This Zionist supremacist hierarchy enjoys portraying itself as a beacon of “democracy and human rights,” when in praxis, it continues to display the exact opposite. Yes, that does in fact mean that Israel is the American Dream on steroids, and sleeps on the ugly side of the pillow; Israel teaches death. This is why the question of Israel/Palestine has never largely been about religion or nationality. There are [Muslim Zionists](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4220976,00.html).
