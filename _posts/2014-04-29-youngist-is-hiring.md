Do you have a knack for film, video, web design, and feel a sense of collective responsibility for our world? Do you want to further develop community art while also fostering other young artists and activists?

<p>{Young}ist is looking for an Arts and Multimedia Editor to join our dynamic team. <p> Our current editorial board is made up of four content editors and we are looking for a fifth member with a background in art – from web design to audio, video, or other multimedia forms.

 Let’s further push artistic intervention while simultaneously exploring and documenting our subcultures. <p>Please submit a cover paragraph including what equipment and editing software you have access to, or any organizations you are a part of, and any other projects or experience you have with digital art and media. E-mail both your cover paragraph and resume to info@youngist.org, and we will respond with further queries.

<p>Thank you for your continued support for youth media from the left and from below.
