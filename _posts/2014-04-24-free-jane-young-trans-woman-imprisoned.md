On this episode we speak with 3 guests — Chris Garaffa and Al Riccio from the Party for Socialism and Liberation and Aaron Romano the attorney of a 16-year-old trans girl who is currently incarcerated in a woman’s prison and held on no charges in Hartford, CT. A survivor of numerous instances of violence and abuse, Jane Doe is now being held in solitary confinement for 22-23 hours per day, without access to education or contact with peers her own age.

Many activists in the Connecticut area are organizing a rally on her behalf this Friday. Check out this [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/645209172199377/) for details. 

If you aren’t able to make it in person on Friday, you can still take action:

1. Sign the Change.org [petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/connecticut-department-of-children-and-families-free-the-16-year-old-transgender-girl-currently-incarcerated-in-an-adult-prison-without-criminal-charges) in support of Jane’s transfer out of prison.

2. Contact Governor Dannel Malloy and tell him that this teen should be released from prison, returned to state custody, and placed in a juvenile facility with youth of her expressed, not assigned, gender. Email him at Governor.Malloy@CT.gov and call him at (800) 406-1527.

3. Share on social media! Set your profile picture to our Justice for Jane image, take a photo with #justiceforjane written on a piece of paper, and post the petition on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with the hashtags #justiceforjane and #girlslikeus.

4. Write a letter to Jane to show your support. Jane needs to know that folks care about her and are standing behind her, and you can get a letter to Jane through her attorney, Aaron Romano (aaronromano@attorneyaaronromano.com).
