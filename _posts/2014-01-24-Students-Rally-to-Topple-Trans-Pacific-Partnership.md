January 22 marked the beginning of a ten-day push by groups who work on a wide variety of issues to stop Congress from granting the President Fast Track for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The push culminates in an [Intercontinental Day of Action](http://www.flushthetpp.org/inter-continental-day-of-action-against-the-tpp-corporate-globalization/) against the TPP on Jan 31 — with events and actions being planned all around the world. 

The TPP [has been called](http://www.thenation.com/article/168627/nafta-steroids) “NAFTA on Steroids,” and if you hate the concept of corporate personhood, consider that from leaked chapters of the TPP text we know that if the TPP passes, we will all be getting used to the phrase corporate nationhood.

Joining me to discuss the growing movement to halt fast track and topple the TPP is Stuart Sidle. Stuart is a senior at Reed College in Portland Oregon where he is engaged with environmental justice activities and serves on the national steering committee for the [United Students for Fair Trade](http://fairtradecampus.wordpress.com/), a grassroots network of students and youth working in solidarity with cooperative communities and workers to promote fair trade principles and models.
