<p><strong><em>Trigger warning:</em> </strong><em>This poem, which is posted here to honor Transgender Day of Remembrance, includes description of sexual assault and anti-transgender violence.</em></p>
<p>they call me crazy when I enter the men&#8217;s room&#8212;</p>
<p>that man</p>
<p>bellowing at the top of his lungs</p>
<p>the hero of the gendered world</p>
<p>marching with his army of</p>
<p>blue and pink swaddles</p>
<p>brandishing his sword of tongues&#8212;</p>
<p>but he&#8212;</p>
<p>he is only a foot soldier.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>former republican executive</p>
<p>Todd Kincannon</p>
<p>said that</p>
<p>there are people who respect</p>
<p>transgender rights</p>
<p>and people who think</p>
<p>we should all be put in a camp</p>
<p>and that he is of the latter</p>
<p>party</p>
<p>and sometimes I cannot breathe</p>
<p>when I think about the Todd Kincannons</p>
<p>who write the law in blood</p>
<p>and vomit hatred</p>
<p>who spit on </p>
<p>human fucking beings</p>
<p>tell me</p>
<p>what is it?</p>
<p>what is it that you are protecting</p>
<p>so dearly</p>
<p>what is it</p>
<p>about my very</p>
<p>existence</p>
<p>that ignites a hatred in you</p>
<p>akin to Adolf Hitler</p>

<p>because the man in the bathroom</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t decide one morning</p>
<p>to begin to hate me</p>
<p>it wasn&#8217;t until you </p>
<p>beat him senseless</p>
<p>with the word &#8220;faggot&#8221;</p>
<p>and he turned around</p>
<p>and shot</p>
<p>Victoria Carmen White</p>
<p>ten miles away from my house</p>
<p>you gave him the key to my city</p>
<p>to call me</p>
<p>a faggot dyke</p>
<p>in a public restroom,</p>
<p>he doesn&#8217;t even know exactly what these words mean</p>
<p>he only knows that they hurt</p>
<p>and he wants me to hurt</p>
<p>the same way he wanted</p>
<p>Brandon Teena</p>
<p>to hurt</p>
<p>when he raped him</p>
<p>and shot him</p>
<p>point blank</p>

<p>I bet he noticed</p>
<p>we have the same haircut</p>
<p>and he&#8217;ll find out </p>
<p>when our blood is pooled on the ground</p>
<p>that it&#8217;s the same color</p>
<p>and the Todd Kincannons</p>
<p>can dip their quills in that blood</p>
<p>and sign the lease to concentration camps</p>
<p>to the asylum</p>
<p>the support group</p>
<p>to the ten commandments of gender roles</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t get to tell me who I am</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t get to decide what my body does and doesn&#8217;t do</p>
<p>and if they want to know why I&#8217;m so fucking angry</p>
<p>well here it is</p>
