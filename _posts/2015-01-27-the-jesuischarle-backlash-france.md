“It is a war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam, against everything that is aimed at breaking fraternity, freedom, solidarity,” - French Prime Minister Manuel Valls

What does it mean to say #JeSuisCharlie?

On the 9th of January, the backlash to the Charlie Hebdo killings gave us a hint. Echoing their prime minister’s call to war, French racists moved quickly to reassert their dominance over the Muslim community, blowing up kebab shops, [shooting up Muslim prayer halls](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2901874/Revenge-attacks-retaliation-begin-Mosques-come-fire-guns-grenades-France-kebab-shop-near-Muslim-temple-blown-up.html) and [throwing grenades](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2901874/Revenge-attacks-retaliation-begin-Mosques-come-fire-guns-grenades-France-kebab-shop-near-Muslim-temple-blown-up.html) into mosques, in assaults which go beyond their [normal, frequent attacks](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/09/islamophobia-in-france_n_6445064.html?ir=India) on Muslims.

[One mosque](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2015/01/09/Racist-graffiti-scrawled-on-French-mosque-.html) in Bayonne was left with scrawls of graffiti that proclaimed both “Charlie freedom” and “Dirty Arabs.” This message, vaunting “Western freedom” and devaluing the “barbaric Orient,” perfectly reflects the “Clash of Civilizations” struggle that Al-Qaeda and Western governments hope to reawaken fresh off the tragedy.

While it is true that Western regimes have long exploited and ruined the lives of people across the Middle East, such a formulation is errant in that it assumes a homogenous people under attack, despite the numerous ideologies, histories, cultures, and economies present in the vast region. As Edward Said argues in “Orientalism”, in fact, Western colonialism was the primary force invoking the idea of the (Middle) East into its antagonistic existence. 

In attacking the office of Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket, Al-Qaeda consciously played into the Orientalist tropes the West trots out about Muslims as irrationally murderous (in this case, over cartoons) and anti-Semitic. The bloody strategy is an adaption [of a textbook Al-Qaeda tactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_of_Savagery): bait Islamophobia, incur Western aggression, and gain more recruits; but it could only work by playing into a deeply entrenched and recognizable stereotypes about the West’s narrow and uncritical perception of the Islamic world.

Unfortunately, the white French public, encouraged by top Western leaders, played right into the trap. In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo killings, the robust #JeSuisCharlie movement has endangered [Muslims in every corner of France](https://www.facebook.com/159659722813/photos/a.284816897813.187537.159659722813/10153596131007814/?type=1&theater), and increasingly in other European countries like Germany and [the Netherlands](http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2015/01/40-of-dutch-mosques-have-been-attacked-daubed-with-racist-graffiti.php/). 

Despite the fact some of the most militant Islamic organizations around the world from [Hamas](https://news.yahoo.com/hamas-condemns-charlie-hebdo-attack-140325193.html) to [Hezbollah](http://rt.com/news/221343-hezbollah-nasrallah-charlie-offends/) have condemned the attacks, leaders from French president Francois Hollande to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, like Al-Qaeda, have been quick to cynically frame this tragedy in terms of the Enlightened West vs. Barbaric Islam.

Holland, channeling his inner Orientalism, [quickly labeled](http://www.ibtimes.com/paris-terror-attack-french-president-decries-barbarism-charlie-hebdo-shooting-france-1775794) the attacks an “exceptional act of barbarism” — a phrase plucked directly from the West’s ugly history of colonialism — and the French government even pledged $1.2 million to Charlie Hebdo, proving what a financial stake it has in keeping the show going. Never to be outdone, Netanyahu called the attacks “brutal acts of savagery” and explained, “The attacks of radical Islam know no boundaries — these are international attacks and the response has to be international. The terrorists want to destroy our freedoms and our civilization.” 

Such broad decontextualized statements only make sense if we assume militant Muslims (from a few Al-Qaeda affiliated youth in France to Hamas fighters in Palestine) are all the same—a racist generalization that ignores the Muslim world’s complex historical development. Nonetheless, reifying this reductive identity politics simultaneously serves to “explain” the West’s domination of remarkably different Muslim societies from Libya to Pakistan in the name of national security. At the same time, it also allows Al-Qaeda’s claim to the mantle of resistance to this domination, regardless of their drastically varying levels of support in these distinct communities.

Thus, the Al-Qaeda assailants, who committed the highly symbolic attack on Charlie Hebdo, and the French government, which is now funding Charlie Hebdo, are both fulfilling the same strategic mission: reinforcing the orientalist clash of civilizations idea (East vs. West, Muslim vs. Secular etc.) and positioning themselves as the legitimate agents of force within that clash. The insincerity reeks. After all, who is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to march through Paris, standing up for free speech, after his country oversaw the slaughter of at least a dozen Palestinian reporters?

Nonetheless, the “they-hate-us-for-our-freedoms-and-cartoons” charade allows France’s liberal establishment to continue attributing the growing resentment young Muslim people feel to an exported fundamentalist ideology, rather than to its homegrown failure to provide them with employment, healthcare, safety, and hope. 

[As it stands now](http://www.thenation.com/article/194593/why-we-must-resist-simple-explanations-charlie-hebdo-massacre), French Muslims are twice as likely as non-Muslims to be unemployed. And although France’s population is only 12% Muslim, France’s inmate population is [60-70%](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/28/ST2008042802857.html) Muslim. Even in prison, the French state discriminates against Muslim inmates, refusing them enough religious leaders, halal options, or even holiday privileges enjoyed by their fellow Christian prisoners.

In 2005, thousands of [young French Muslims](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/06/france.focus) took over their streets, rioting against unemployment, police killings, and dismal public housing conditions. But France’s intelligence service concluded the movement was not motivated by religious extremism and France’s proudly liberal society largely ignored their demands for help. Curiously in that moment, Western leaders globally did not jump in to frame the burnings of thousands of cars or the numerous clashes with police as an attack on “our civilization,” though it clearly was.

The problem with the 2005 French riots was that it directly challenged the supposed fairness of the French social democratic compact. The French white public could not respond, guns and grenade in hand, because the anti-police and anti-poverty riots revealed the hypocrisy of the nation’s liberal order.

In stark contrast, after the Charlie Hebdo killings, France’s white majority, and its sympathetic Western allies, immediately responded with collective violence to an extremely isolated “attack on Free Speech.” By attacking Muslims across the country who had nothing to do with the executions carried out by a handful, the French public viciously reaffirmed for itself the illusion that the fundamental divisions in society are due to Muslim immigrants’ ideological extremism, rather than their own institutional racism.

With the #JeSuisCharlie movement, the French white public affirms the seductive orientalist binary Al-Qaeda offered with the attack. It will take up its role as defenders of “the rights of man” and Al-Qaeda will take its role as the fundamentalist Islamists, hell bent on achieving the caliphate.

So where does this leave the Muslim community in France? And what path to resistance are they in fact left with?  

Time will tell. But in the meantime let’s stop playing the “Clash of Civilizations” charade. #JeSuisCharlie is not about free speech.
