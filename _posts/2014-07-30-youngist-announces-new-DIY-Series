Youngist is going to start curating a new series for the month of August under the theme: _millennial do it yourself_. 

**Think:** youth culture as it intersects with politics. Everything from skate crews, youth-led alternatives to incarceration, queer haircutting collectives, student-run co-operatives, zinesters, DJs, hackers ....... anything that falls under that!

We want you to participate and tell your friends! Send pitches/suggestions/ideas/submissions to **Isabelle@youngist.org**! Multimedia submissions [comics, podcasts, photo essays, videos, etc] are a major plus. 

And yes, we pay contributors!
