      <title>Students Fined $5,000 for Activism by Wesleyan University - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/students-fined-for-activism-by-wesleyan-university</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The self-proclaimed “Diversity University” is at it again.  Wesleyan University, located in Middletown, Connecticut, is prosecuting three trans* and gender-nonconforming students for taking political action to address transgender discrimination on campus.  This comes just one year after the University reversed their need blind admission policy, and a rash of racial profiling by the campus police, Public Safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, December 4th, Wesleyan University will be holding a disciplinary hearing against the three aforementioned trans* and gender-nonconforming students.  The charges against the three stem from actions taken this October to “degender” public restrooms.  These students are being targeted because of their visibility in these actions and in the LGBTQ community on campus, despite no evidence that they are indeed responsible for the $5,245 in fines they are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning this October, Wesleyan students began removing gender signs from public restrooms across campus. In place of the gender signs, they posted new all gender signs as well as manifestos which explained their actions: “We demand that Wesleyan University stop segregating bathrooms along gender lines and provide all-gender bathrooms in all buildings in the University. We believe gender-segregated bathrooms create uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situations for trans&lt;em&gt; and gender-variant presenting people. We believe gender-segregated bathrooms reinforce trans&lt;/em&gt; invisibility at Wesleyan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manifesto was signed by an anonymous group “Pissed Off Trans* People,” and the group provided manifestos and all-gender signs available for download online.  The materials soon had over 200 downloads and many students outside of the original group were participating on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charges stem from one incident in the student center when a university employee stopped a group of five students suspected of degendering two restrooms. From this moment on things got confusing. Only three of the five students have been brought up on charges and face disciplinary consequences. These three students are being singled out for punishment because of their visibility in the LGBTQ community and are being forced to carry the weight of all degendering activism on campus this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire disciplinary process has been mired with confusion and secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several meetings with University administrators, the accused students have been met with hostility and obstinance. Administrators have made it difficult to obtain basic information necessary for the students to defend themselves including public safety reports and the calculation of the $5,245 fine. Two of the accused students weren’t even informed they were being charged until several weeks after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the three trans* and gender-nonconforming students were meeting with various administrators, they frequently received contradictory information. Even such basic information as the extent and specific of their charges were unclear. The judicial process has been inconsistent and has resulted in a chaotic and isolating experience, leaving them unable to adequately defend themselves and putting unneeded stress on students during the final weeks of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these inconsistencies and frustrations the basis of these charges have been questionable at best. The indictment of the three trans&lt;em&gt; students is based on the notion of preponderance: the assumption that one piece of evidence is sufficient to prove a guilty verdict, and that the accused are guilty unless proven innocent. Although there is only evidence that the three trans&lt;/em&gt; and gender-nonconforming students were present at the sign removal in the campus center, they are being charged for the removal all the bathroom gender signs on the entire university campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the middle of the proceedings and negotiations with the administration the fine was nearly doubled from about $3,000 to over $5,000. The fine breaks down to $157 per sign plus additional unexplained fees. This calculation comes in spite of an offer from mydoorsign.com to donate all-gender signs to the University for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of these proceedings has indicted the accused students as guilty from the outset and has served to make an example of students who decide to transgress the rules that govern public space and take direct political action to alleviate the oppression faced by trans* and gender-nonconforming and LGBTQ students on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial takes place this Wednesday, December 4th at 4:30 pm, in the North College administrative building.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rage, Language and Audre Lorde - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/rage-language-and-audre-lorde</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Photo: Courtesy of Youth Activists-Youth Allies Network. A group of young people sitting in a circule of chairs in a community center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a colorful circle of young people, organizers, teachers and students, a young woman called Zainab shared her experience of what happened to her that day: “I was getting sexually harassed by this dickhead on the street, and when I went and told two cops who were standing right in front of him: they did nothing and continued to tell me that I should probably think about what I was wearing before I stepped out of the house!” Zainab was wearing a beautiful sundress that day, her legs freely expressing her happiness with her body and the weather. The two cops were women of color, and Zainab was even angrier that two women whose lived experience was probably more similar to hers showed no solidarity with her situation. They were actively perpetuating the same sexist thinking that patriarchal society has embedded in our social fabric, women of color, men, brothers alike. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a reality in most women’s lives, and when we start talking about our lived experiences as women, we often find ourselves running out of time to discuss everything that’s on our minds. “Do we have time to talk about sexism, patriarchy and self esteem right now?” I thought to myself. We were running on a tight schedule that day, where I was to facilitate a workshop on the occupation of Palestine, something the young folks are eager to learn more about. I thought about the stories that would reveal themselves to be necessary learning experiences and expressions of self. The narratives would prove to re-affirm the hyper-sexist, misogynist culture we live in. The room was filled with women, and I wondered how many of them went through similar, if not more odious violations of their femininity, of their safety, their self-esteem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We were in a space where we shared stories of sexual assault that highlighted a culture of patriarchy, and each story was connected with a person’s unique emotional experiences. Most of us grew up in New York City, spoke English, had experienced the public school struggle, and were working part-time gigs. I’m always intentional about facilitating dialogue with people in controlled settings that are reflective of many of the values I find are needed for a safe space. We were youth, activists, leaders, and women who had dissident and critically conscious voices. I loved the culture of conversation in certain activist spaces; it was always filled with energy and things that I learned from consistently. We spoke regularly of a culture that is masterful at finding reasons to justify rape and victim blaming, rather than teaching men not to rape. We spoke of a patriarchy beyond male-cis-gendered binaries, and placed sexuality within a critical pedagogy framework that actively dismantled colonized notions of our identities and communities.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A young woman named Siranha, wearing her brightly patterned skirt with elephants and sanskrit, and her matching wooden earrings, raised her hand to speak. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I just want to scream ‘Fuck you!’ You know? I want to ask them to stop being such dick head douchebags and go jerk off. I want to ask them what the fuck their mothers have taught them, and how I cannot wait till they have daughters.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I listened attentively as Siranha passionately spoke about her personal reaction to sexual harassment. Her energy captivated me, and I thought of the emotions that run through my head when I’ve escaped what-I-thought-to-be-a-deadly-encounter with a man on my walk home late at night. As a woman, I connected with her experience. As a youth trainer, I had to think like the “teacher-in-me” who wants to encourage “positive” dialogue and expression of emotion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then, I thought: what’s positive?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As youth trainers and community organizers, we build movements through dialogue. In spaces like this workshop creates, we talk about what triggers trauma and how we can understand our experiences as part of a broader system of structural oppression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Siranha’s comment garnered a response. Shaila had remarked: “God, that woman is so angry.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I winced. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;God. Siranha &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;so angry. This young woman of color fit the exact stereotype I often find myself battling. She was the angry woman of color who will loudly dismiss people by saying “Fuck you!” while calling people “dickheads and douchebags.” Siranha and Zainab had both shared stories of men that violated their sexuality, their womanhood, and their humanity. They had both experienced traumatizing situations, that more often than not repeated themselves, and were victims of a culture that did not see them as human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how many women of color have had to suppress their emotions in order to not be characterized as an angry woman of color? I thought about anger, and the experiences that evoke similar emotions that we have not processed as a community. We experience difficult situations that test our patience, our resilience, our ability to deal with the world. Our communities of women, marginalized people and traumatized communities have never been given the opportunity to break down all these experiences and learn how to deal emotionally. We never address anger as a transformative experience; I’ve grown up learning being angry is a negative thing and that I must control the way I react to a sexist, racist, classist society.  I identified with the anger of this young woman—it was the same anger I found myself battling when I dealt with, for example, the Muslim feminist “liberators” who claimed the hijab was oppressive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Siranha’s comment sheds light on a reactionary dialogue that plays itself out in many of the interactions that women, young people, oppressed communities, and marginalized people have: her side comment exemplified how our society reacts to anger. We are dismissive of anger, regardless of whether or not it is a justified reaction to violence, sexism, racism and classism. We tell ourselves that anger is really just a signifier of weakness, thereby creating an environment where the normalization of a traumatic, violent, and oppressive culture is seen as appropriate. We silence victims who have every right to be angry and to take up space with that anger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We end up perpetuating an affective police state where we tell people like Zainab, a woman whose worst case scenario reaction would be to curse out the police officers, that they are wrong for reacting that way. We tell women like Siranha, whose impulsive reaction to sexual harassment would be to threaten her harassers, that they need to control their emotions. We prescribe patience and perseverance as a solution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The world is full of situations that evoke anger in us. The raw emotions of hate we feel for violence, discrimination and oppression—this is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;justified &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rage. We saw this anger when members of organizations like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://onebillionrising.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;One Billion Rising&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and Indian women demanded capital punishment for the men who raped &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policymic.com/articles/22727/jyoti-singh-pandey-gang-rape-victim-dying-declaration-to-doom-perpetrators&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jyoti Singh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in Delhi, and when women formed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXwH-kjSUSs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;vigilante groups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throughout Uttar Pradesh to combat sexual violence. The pervasive culture of sexual violence has organized cries of anger throughout communities across the world, particularly angry women of color who are taking matters into their own hands and mobilizing their communities through grassroots initiatives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;               &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/7bd0665d75ac6207ac14491fdf016e51/tumblr_inline_movcla0NwL1qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Photo: Audre Lorde speaking with one hand held towards the viewer and the other holding a microphone to her lips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In her essay &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40005441?uid=2&amp;amp;;uid=4&amp;amp;;sid=21102111224361&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Uses of Anger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, feminist scholar, poet, and political activist Audre Lorde describes anger as a “well stocked arsenal [&amp;#8230;] potentially useful against those oppressions, personal and institutional, that have brought those emotions into being.” Lorde looks at anger by examining the microaggressions oppressed communities, particularly women of color, face daily. She re-conceptualizes anger as a positive tool for social change, while calling out the elite white supremacist class that is quick to dismiss people of color and their expressions of self. The same anger that we are suppressing and silencing has been created by a system that is actively prescribing silence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This anger is a marker of the truth in a system built on lies. It is the truth because it is grounded in our lived experience. If we let it be dismissed, then the oppression that caused the anger is tossed aside too. We are women of color and working class immigrants who are policing our own thoughts for fear of being labeled and told that we are angry, too loud, too aggressive, or too “hood.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am actively lifting the veil on our raw emotions by encouraging uncensored language, and discouraging emotional policing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lorde goes on to write, “I cannot hide my anger to spare your guilt, nor hurt feelings, nor answering anger; for to do so insults and trivializes all our efforts.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anger is a legitimate form of expression that should be accepted, supported, and used as crucial evidence of lived experience as we build our analyses of the social dynamics that produce such internal tension. Anger is a legitimate tool for analyzing social relationships and our guilt or reluctance to express our anger is socially constructed, and upheld by a society that does not process their emotions enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The way we express our anger—the language we use to communicate our emotions—is bound up in the structures of oppression that create mainstream narratives around the use of anger. Our language is policed, the manner in which we express ourselves is deemed “sensitive” or “over-dramatic,” and there are always hindrances within this oppressive structure in dealing with these emotions. We are told profanity is not classy, so screaming “Fuck you!” at an abuser is a fault on our side. We are told that we must be patient and these normalized experiences of oppression are a test to our personality, instead of creating a narrative that challenges the perpetrator. Processing anger can be a tool for transformative justice, and the way in which we air our legitimate feelings. Reclaiming language is a political act. We can take back words that are deemed “inappropriate” and confront people with the emotions that those words signify. In order to not alienate people in our communities, we must legitimize their opinions and accept the language they use to express themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A big part of self-care and understanding our relationships and the role we play in the world around us is taking a careful look at the interpersonal dynamics in the social fabric of our lives. Unfortunately, in a world where we have less and less time to process our feelings, with little or no time for self-care and community building. Our emotions are often dismissed and devalued. It is critical to recognize &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;feeling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; as a part of an ethos of self-care, and to include processing our reactions to a world that is making it more difficult for us to connect to our communities and our non-consumer oriented selves within that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I myself am processing anger, as a valid emotion that should be legitimized by our community and shedding light on social dynamics. I’m learning how to create dialogues around situations of anger, and how we can be more critical of emotional and physical factors that influence behavioral patterns and the dialogue around our behavior. A community that is inclusive of anger involves dialogue around anger, and the way in which we express our anger to be deconstructed and re-addressed inclusive of the power dynamics. We must address the colonization of language, our identities and our interpersonal relationships within these processes. Anger must be looked at through a transformative lens, and community practices should be revolving around the dynamic experiences of trauma, violence and oppression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep up with Sharmin on Twitter @SharminUltraa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet the Editors: Queen Arsem-O&#39;Malley! - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-queen-arsem-omalley</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>info@youngist.org ({young}ist)</author>
      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-queen-arsem-omalley</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I’m Queen, one of the editors for Youngist. I’m a 21-year-old recent graduate who should probably spend more time looking for jobs and less time watching Arrested Development. I previously wrote and edited for a campus newspaper at McGill, and am currently also an editor for CanCulture, an online magazine devoted to covering Canadian culture from a youth perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are you based? Where are you from?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I’m currently based in Montreal, Quebec, where I attended McGill University. I’m originally from Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#8217;s your favorite thing about the place that you live? What about where you are from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;My favourite thing about Montreal is the great selection of dive bars. My favourite thing about Boston is the Red Sox and Dunkin’ Donuts (though I guess those apply to all of New England).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did you go to school (high school and college, if applicable)? What is your experience with educational institutions? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I went to high school in Boston at a school that emphasizes its rigidity, reputation, and tradition, and then went to McGill, which does the same thing. I spent a lot of my time at McGill writing for The Daily, an independent student newspaper, trying to keep the administration accountable and communicative, and pushing institutional change that would make higher education less -ist and -phobic (classist, racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, etc.). I graduated extremely frustrated with the inaccessibility of higher education and the stubborn refusal of those in charge to open their eyes and listen to their students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get involved with Youngist? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I had known Izzy for a little while – we met through mutual friends, and then spent time together in Quebec during the student strike and I loved following the work of NYSR and CUNY activism, so she reached out to me to be a part of Youngist. I originally came into Youngist as a contributor, and was super excited about the project, and eventually joined as an editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe the current &amp;#8220;online mediascape&amp;#8221;? Where do you think young people (15-30) should get their news and analysis? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think the online mediascape – mainstream news outlets, alternative news outlets, the blogosphere, social media – can be pretty overwhelming, and it can be hard to tell what the motives/agenda/backgrounds are of the people writing and commenting on current events. I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;get a lot of my news through social media, because I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;can choose who to follow, and learn about news through the lens of people and organizations that I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; already know and understand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How, if at all, do you think social media can be used as a tool in grassroots organizing?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Social media has an amazing capacity for making connections that you would never be able to make otherwise, across borders and movements and even languages. I think it can add great visibility for grassroots organizing, and has an ability to reach people who aren’t exposed to organizing or social justice in their physical communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to be able to accomplish through Youngist for our first year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I hope that we are able to become a venue for young activists to feel comfortable writing and creating work about projovements that they feel passionately about, and a place for safe and productive discussion about issues facing young people and young activists in both their work and day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet the Editors: Zach Bell! - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-zach-bell</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>info@youngist.org ({young}ist)</author>
      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-zach-bell</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/5ecffc978178f83220837b9b1e52f23c/tumblr_inline_mop5xkuo6U1qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A tightrope walker between skyscrapers made of Jello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are you based? Where are you from?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I’m based in Bedstuy, Brooklyn and originally from New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#8217;s your favorite thing about the place that you live? What about where you are from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In Bed stuy, the Marcy Playground. It’s the best basketball I’ve played in Brooklyn and there’s a consistent crew that all knows each other and is out every day there’s a dry court. In New Haven, Clark’s Dairy. When I was a kid, I would get a tall black raspberry milkshake with my mom every Wednesday as we’d wait for my brother to finish his violin lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did you go to school (high school and college, if applicable)? What is your experience with educational institutions? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I moved out of New Haven to an exemplar boring suburb when I was thirteen and went to Amity Regional High School, the type of school where North Faces, Solo pants, and Tims flooded the halls. I tried to integrate myself into the school—played sports every season, did clubs, drank—but I never quite found my scene. Then I shipped out to Philadelphia to go to the University of Pennsylvania with high hopes of finding a community of like-minded folks. Turns out the institution wasn’t all that nurturing, and I bounced around from a stand up comedy club, a fraternity, service groups and a senior society looking for arms to lock with. It wasn’t until my senior year, particularly with Occupy Penn, that I felt a little more at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get involved with Youngist? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I was interning at &lt;em&gt;Salon.com&lt;/em&gt; and freelancing to sites like &lt;em&gt;Truth-out&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Alternet&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt;’s student blog. I was focusing on student issues and was really frustrated with how marginalized the content was on some of the sites, not to mention my own role as an intern. I had been at the National Student Power Convergence over the summer and felt like there was more than enough skill and drive among young organizers and writers to do it all ourselves. I spoke about the idea of youth-run, youth-targeted website with James Cersonsky (one of {young}ist’s contributors now!) who I’d become friends with in Philly. He was interning at &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt; at the time and we wondered if perhaps already existing lefty news organizations could just be altered, and James set out making the Student Nation what it is today adding the popular “student dispatches” feature. Still, I felt like the distance between the contributions and capabilities of young people in the mediascape was growing every day. I was also seeing how troubling it was when youth couldn’t speak for themselves, like when I covered the various “youth panels” at the Democratic National Convention. I spoke with Max Berger (now on our advisory board!) about the idea that I’d shelved in my mind, and he told me that it was the time to act. A week later I met with Isabelle (who I’d known for a while through student organizing) at the Washington Square Diner and {Young}ist was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe the current &amp;#8220;online mediascape&amp;#8221;? Where do you think young people (15-30) should get their news and analysis? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Uniform and unexpressive. &lt;em&gt;Democracy Now! &lt;/em&gt;is my favorite source of news all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How, if at all, do you think social media can be used as a tool in grassroots organizing?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Organizing is about topology—it doesn’t matter what form it’s in, it just matters in what configurations the nodes are connected. I think we’re in a fascinating liminal period when folks from around the world are recognizing that it’s a choice whether or not to adhere to old structures based on geographic proximity or a constructed affinity. Social media exposes the arbitrary nature of these structures and let’s us ask with fresh eyes: how do we define community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to be able to accomplish through Youngist for our first year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;I’ve got big hopes for the participatory user experience of the site, which we’ve currently got on dock for our “second roll out” (one step at a time). If we get that far, the site might really become a place for on-to-offline campaign making, enterprise forming, and art collaboration. It might also make it the go to place for young people to find the most popular (crowd-voted) art that people their age around the world are making. So, I think that’s my hope for our first year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F97576880&amp;amp;;liking=false&amp;amp;;sharing=false&amp;origin=tumblr&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;soundcloud_audio_player&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;Podcast: The Great Selfie Debate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nia King and Teagan Widmer on &amp;#8220;Selfies&amp;#8221;, Millennial Self-Representation, and the Saturated Visual Economy of Tumblr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Teagan (Twid) Widmer and guest contributor Nia King; music courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://safe.bandcamp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SAFE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://artactivistnia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nia King&lt;/a&gt; is a mixed-race queer art activist from Boston, Massachusetts. She currently resides in Oakland, California where she runs the podcast &lt;a href=&quot;http://niapod.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We Want the Airwaves: QPOC Artists on the Rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcribed Selection Below: &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia King&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s been a lot of conversations recently about how our generation is allegedly super-narcissistic and how social media is making us narcissistic and I think selfies, or self-portraits, have been pointed to as the evidence of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first question is, do you think that it’s accurate that our generation is perhaps more vain, and that selfies are a product of that? And secondly, do you think that’s a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teagan (Twid) Widmer&lt;/strong&gt;: I don’t think we’re necessarily more vain. I think selfies are a good thing. I’m pro-selfie. I just want to start with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s part of a marginalized group, I spent a lot of time not being able to tell my own story. Not being able to present myself the way that I wanted to present myself. Finding myself in situations where I had to let other people present me, or be represented in a way that the dominant culture saw me. I think self-portraiture allows for a way to challenge that. To say “No, I’m going to take control of how I look. I’m going to put my best foot forward, what I consider to be my best foot, not what you consider to be my best foot, cause I think often those are two different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, it’s very different when you take a selfie versus when somebody takes a picture of you in public and uploads it to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twid&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. I feel like selfies looks like me, and when other people take pictures of me, they don’t look like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia&lt;/strong&gt;: I can see what you’re saying about selfies give you control over how you represent yourself to the world, but how many selfies do you really need to do that? Because people don’t just take one selfie, a lot of times they’re taking and posting selfies like all the time. And even if you’re transitioning, you’re face doesn’t change that much from day to the next. So… what’s that about? [laughing]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twid&lt;/strong&gt;: I work a job where I wear a uniform, and this uniform is very de-gendering for me. It’s like a big ski-jacket type of thing, and like an orange polo, and then grey pants. None of it is really cut for women. When I first got there, they only had men’s stuff. I’ve been able to get women’s pieces but they’re not…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia&lt;/strong&gt;: They’re not flattering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twid&lt;/strong&gt;: They’re not flattering. So I have to go do that 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. So when I finish a shift, in which I’ve probably been misgendered multiple times - also because I’m usually wearing a hat where my hair is up, I’m less likely to be gendered correctly – so sometimes that can be really mentally taxing on me. At the end of the day, when I get on BART, when I’m back in my normal clothes, it can be really helpful for me to take a selfie, and look at myself, and say, “Oh, I don’t really look like a boy. Ok. I’m ok,” you know? I feel like sometimes that’s just really calming. And that’s not an every day thing, but some days are worse than others, and some days I need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twid&lt;/strong&gt;: Why are you anti-selfie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m someone who mostly uses social media to promote my work as an artist. I think the reason I get frustrated is that I feel like I’m competing with selfies and cat photos, and you just can’t win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I interviewed Dr. Kortney Ryan Ziegler, he said something that really stuck with me. He said, “I had to take a break from social media because it was starting to hurt my feelings. It’s easy to forget that people don’t necessarily go to social media to find ground-breaking new work. They go to social media to look at cat photos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8220;I think when you’re an artist&lt;/span&gt;s&lt;span&gt; who’s doing something like putting 8-10 hours into editing a podcast, and then you put it on tumblr and it gets like 8 notes…&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;… and then you see a cat photo or a selfie with like a gajillion, it feels like you’re just banging you’re head against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel like there’s also like a… tumblr in particular is like a visual economy, right? It’s all about pretty photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twid&lt;/strong&gt;: Totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nia&lt;/strong&gt;: So what if you’re not cute? You know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, what if your face isn’t what you want to share, or what you feel like is the thing of most value that you bring to the world? And also, what if you’re not that crazy about the way you look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me as a woman [and an artist], it feels really important to be valued for what I create and not what I look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like selfies are great if you have “cute privilege,” but what if you don’t? Where do you belong in the selfie economy? (20:00)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like this post? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/we-want-the-airwaves-qpoc-artists-on-the-rise/x/3057848&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; Nia&amp;#8217;s podcast &lt;span&gt;We Want the Airwaves&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meet the Editors: Muna Mire! - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-muna-mire</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>info@youngist.org ({young}ist)</author>
      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/meet-the-editors-muna-mire</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My name is Muna Mire, my pronouns are she/her/hers they/them/theirs. I&amp;#8217;m a student journalist. Nice to meet you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are you based? Where are you from?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m based in Toronto right now which is where I am originally from, so things have sort of come full circle for me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whats your favorite thing about the place that you live? What about where you are from? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My favourite thing about Toronto is the culture of the city. It&amp;#8217;s constantly surprising me by reinventing itself in really interesting ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did you go to school (high school and college, if applicable)? What is your experience with educational institutions?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I attended high school with Hira, actually. We went to high school in the Deep South, aka metro Atlanta, aka in the middle of nowhere. Toronto has been quite a change of pace for me. My experience with educational institutions has been &amp;#8230; contradictory. I find them profoundly alienating as a woman of color but I am also confronted with the idea that education is really important to the project of bettering myself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;How did you get involved with Youngist?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I knew a friend who was already involved (Hira) and I met Isabelle through her, not even intending to get involved with Youngist but wanting to connect with other cool folks. I knew that Youngist was coming along and when I finally got around to checking it out, I was so impressed that *I* approached Isabelle about getting more involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe the current &amp;#8220;online mediascape&amp;#8221;? Where do you think young people (15-30) should get their news and analysis?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current online mediascape is really diverse, so I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I can succinctly describe it. I would venture that it is very much about streamlined, niche content these days. Young people seem to get their news and analysis from a few key places (at least young people clued into news and analysis) that are primarily run by older stakeholders. I&amp;#8217;m not going to tell anyone where to get their news but I think the idea of young people-powered media is very compelling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How, if at all, do you think social media can be used as a tool in grassroots organizing?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen social media (and Twitter in particular) recently deployed to great success in holding institutions be they governments, corporations, political advocacy or nongovernmental organizations, or even the media, accountable. I also think social media is very useful in promoting fundraising initiatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to be able to accomplish through Youngist for our first year?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope to be able to bring together a well-rounded collective of voices through my editorial work with Youngist. Aside from establishing a global contributor base, I hope to be able to bring my own voice to the table on a number of issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Youngist Launches Crowdfunding Campaign! - {young}ist</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/youngist-launches-crowdfunding-campaign</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>info@youngist.org ({young}ist)</author>
      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/youngist-launches-crowdfunding-campaign</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/tk_8-jj1nj4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DONATE &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/youngist-young-people-powered-media/x/3057848?c=home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why make a site like this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the globe, our generation is coming to terms with extreme economic and climate crises. In the midst of these crises, we are connecting the online internet buzz of social media with offline action&amp;#8212;and doing it better than mainstream media ever could. It’s about time we had our own space; a platform to allow us to speak for ourselves. To one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our generation is sharing information rapidly and the way that we produce our own information is constantly shifting. And so are the power dynamics. Entire movements—from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street—have been catalyzed through the perfect chemistry of face-to-face organizing, branded aesthetics, and social media communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is young people who are the ones at the forefront of these movements while simultaneously deciphering the most effective and efficient strategies to get our stories out to greater audiences. However, there are few platforms that facilitate the ascension of youth into the roles of: strategist, designer, or author. Herein lies the problem: there is no website that is run entirely for youth. And so, we need a home of our own—for us and by us—on the internet.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Group photo of Youngist staff sitting on couch&quot; height=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/2F1n1l2W1h2k0O0I3H3T/IMG_6458.JPG&quot; width=&quot;580&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our core staff includes student organizers from New York City, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, techy designer folk, multimedia artists, slam poets, a Montreal transplant whose journalistic coverage of the Quebec student strike received international attention, marketing and social media gurus who have worked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nystudentsrising.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York Students Rising,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://18millionrising.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18 Million Rising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.99rise.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;99Rise&lt;/a&gt; (lots of rising!), and some online media folks who have written for and worked at publications like &lt;a href=&quot;http://salon.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alternet.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alternet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;and our combined age is 138!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we have a range of interests, our common vision is found in seeing young artists and activists work together to tell the stories of our generation—and together we&amp;#8217;re developing a way to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testimonies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m supporting {young}ist because I owe it to another generation of activists, artists, and writers who are striving to create a critical online space that reflects a vibrant youth movement, and because we&amp;#8217;ll all benefit once they&amp;#8217;re able to do so. Your donation reflects your commitment to a more just world—one where youth deliberately carve out a space for their voices, and where the rest of us deliberately listen.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Aura Bogado, Reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorlines.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Colorlines.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;People north of forty years old, speak in blanket terms about &amp;#8220;younger generations&amp;#8221; as if they are inactive sleepwalkers. When in fact, older generations have polluted our food, medicated our nation, removed arts, robbed our banking system, profitized prisons, controlled education and slight of hand&amp;#8212;sullied the playing field, toward an unspoken oligarchy. {Young}ist, is a force~filled way for discussions, mandates, missions and humans&amp;#8212;to potentially evolve.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Victoria Mahoney, Director and Producer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/movies/zoe-kravitz-in-yelling-to-the-sky-by-victoria-mahoney.html?_r=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yelling to the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, award-winning independent film&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m supporting {young}ist because the radical voices of our generation are silenced. You won’t hear from marginalized youth on television. You won’t see the art they create on the walls of a gallery. {young}ist will amplify these voices: it will also connect them. Spaces of creation and reflection are often lacking from our shared experience of activism. May a fresh, young perspective on media fill that void? {young}ist is proof of a resounding yes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~ Jérémie Wien-Bernard, Spokesperson for Quebec student union, ASSE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we exceed the goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course! The more of your funding we receive, the more we will be able to do in terms of making our start-up as smooth as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who will be writing for {Young}ist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s not just writing. But you can see the bios of our contributors &lt;a href=&quot;http://youngist.tumblr.com/about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you including global voices as a part of {Young}ist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team is very dedicated to building a global contributor base and is currently recruiting writers, musicians, artists, movers and shakers from around the world who are involved in innovative work in their communities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of content will be published on {Young}ist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question! You can check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/youngist-young-people-powered-media/x/youngist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; that we’ve started where you can find the first pieces of content our contributors have put together with the support of our editorial team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know an awesome young person. How can I get them involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! We are accepting applications for contributors. Please send an inquiry to isabelle.nastasia (at) gmail (dot) com for more information about this process!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  By Nic Eaton Special thanks to Jess Turturro, Constantine Tziovaras and Witness
  Against Torture.

  117 days of hunger, 166 prisoners. While Twitter and Facebook repeat the refrain,
  even the most conscious of us can start to see numbers rather than people. The struggle
  to  shut down Guantanamo Bay (and other torture black sites like it) has been going
  on well before I took an active role. Countless heroes have dedicated their time
  and energy to bringing the reality of Guantanamo to the streets of the United States
  - internalizing this atrocity and domesticating the problem.

  As my roommate and I donned the orange jumpsuit and hood, our privilege became astoundingly
  clear. We could take off the jumpsuit. We could adjust the hood. We could come and
  go as we pleased. We were not imprisoned, tortured, ridiculed or harassed. We could
  see our friends and families and we could sleep without nightmares.


  As you do a load of laundry, take a drag of your cigarette, flip through 300 channels,
  or mutter as you drag yourself to work imagine the line of prisoners who trail behind
  you and those who lay beneath your feet. Resolve yourself to lift them up and walk
  beside them or resign yourself to contributing to their endless suffering.

  Nic Eaton is a labor organizer and member of the Organization for a Free Society.

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;How I Pulled Off the Common App Hoax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By David Ramirez and {Young}ist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Photo: David Ramirez (me) wearing a suit and tie at the NCORE conference as  &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;Daniel Vargas&amp;#8221;, fictionalized Communications Director of Common App, Inc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took several months, almost a dozen people and several organizations (including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iyjl.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Immigrant Youth Justice League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomuniversitygeorgia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freedom University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatodayeducate.com/staging/index.php/toolbox/group-creates-fair-common-app-for-undocumented-students&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fair Common App&lt;/a&gt;) to plan and execute the prank on Common Application Inc. – tricking three news outlets into spreading fake news that the corporation responsible for facilitating college application submissions had changed its policies towards undocumented students and issued a formal apology to the undocumented community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information was received Tuesday evening that the video released on Thursday was of me, an undocumented activist, poet and a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fightbacknews.org/2011/4/7/8-undocumented-youth-arrested-georgia-hundreds-march-protest-education-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Georgia 8&lt;/a&gt;. I did this because I am undocumented, my community is undocumented, and my community is under attack by the Common Application, which is stealing the hopes and dreams of my undocumented brothers and sisters across the country. I made the announcement because it needed to be said. I hope the Common Application repeats it word for word in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This The Yes Men-style action was organized by myself and a group of self-described “undoculovers” in order to call attention to the barriers undocumented students face in all educational institutions – not merely Common App. Now it’s everybody else&amp;#8217;s turn to rise to the occasion as a movement, take action, and engage in purposeful dialogue to move people to the Left, in the direction of the immigrant justice movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to posit this as an opportunity for people to critique their caper and employ ever-more creative, innovative actions. Several tactics have been employed by the immigrant rights movement and this is the freshest and best intersection of art and activism that we’ve have been able to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This action is a prime example of the bravery, innovation and determination undocumented youth and our allies have brought to the migrant and educational justice movements. Signing on to the action because of its part in a broader organizing strategy – one that included clear, winnable, and deeply-felt objectives, identification of targets who could give activists what they want, and selection of tactics that would get activists closer to their goals – I agreed to impersonate the Common App Communications Director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My performative embodiment of Daniel Vargas, a wry caricature of American citizen and corporate elite, received press from the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/06/the_common_app_makes_room_for_undocumented_students.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Colorlines.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voxxi.com/common-application-undocumented-students/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VOXXI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mycuentame.org/common_application_inc_apologizes_bans_discrimination_against_undocumented_students_across_the_country&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cuentame&lt;/a&gt; as if the Common App decision was real, and was trolled by a Huffington Post journalist on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Georgia’s ban on undocumented youth enrollment in public universities, most undocumented students’ only option is to apply to private colleges. Unfortunately, over 400 of the private colleges partnered with Common App routinely discriminate against undocumented applicants by labeling them “international,” guaranteeing them a separate, unequal admissions process. &lt;a href=&quot;http://u.org/uploadedFiles/AASCU/Content/Root/PolicyAndAdvocacy/PolicyPublications/PM_UndocumentedStudents-March2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to one study&lt;/a&gt;, as few as 5% of undocumented students ever attend college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have extended an invitation to Common App Executive Director Rob Killion to meet with them at the Georgia-based Freedom University, a volunteer-run project offering free college-level classes to undocumented students. Killion has not responded to my offer to discuss the hopes and struggles of undocumented students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions to my speech have varied, but the undocumented youth activist community has been overwhelmingly supportive of the action and view targeting of Common App as an important step in the fight for immigrant rights and educational justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitzy, an undocumented Freedom University student, commented: &amp;#8220;The Common Application oppresses our community, segregates our nation&amp;#8217;s higher education system by immigration status, so our community is fighting back. I feel like the headline should read &amp;#8216;Brown v. Board retracted: Supreme Court Blames Activists for Hoax Ruling.’&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My poem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Movimiento Nacional de Pendojos y Mamones Unidos, the organization I am president of, takes full responsibility for the planning and execution of this action. Jose Salaazar, acting Vice-President, was integral in building consensus amongst our members. He acted with such fierce competency that he gambled his position amongst our ranks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DreamActivist Louisiana found us housing in New Orleans, our trip was guided by God himself, and our safety was secured by our love for one another. Together we march still. Marching marching marching marching. My name is Jorge Mena when he wears a beret, my father is Juan Mangandi, and I invite you to come out like me. Milk and Dada and a chorus of the merriest of illegal-lovers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I think here we should move in the direction of our parents. By which I mean my undocumented ones. Let’s resonate with both demographics represented by each of yours when we consider messaging. Is that clear? We’re moving in the direction of inclusion in the ongoing immigration debate. Immigrants are a construction. “Undocumented immigrants” is our new base. We’ve come a way from “illegal-alien.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;COMMON APP&amp;#8221; PRESS RELEASE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Common Application, Inc. announced two changes to the upcoming version of the Common App, the college application used by high school students across the country. The 2013-2014 version of the Common App (CA4) will become available Aug. 1, 2013 and will include these changes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8220;Undocumented American” will be added as an option in the demographics portion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Undocumented status” will be added to The Common Application Inc.’s non-discrimination clause, which legally binds the 527 member institutions who accept the application (2013-2014).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLORLINES.COM &lt;a href=&quot;http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/06/the_common_app_makes_room_for_undocumented_students.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ORIGINAL POST&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undocumented students won a major victory in their fight for higher education access last week. On Thursday, The Common Application, Inc. the organization which organizes the unified college application students can use to apply to over 400 colleges, issued a formal apology to undocumented students who they’ve excluded from their work and materials for 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been duped. The undocumented community has been the butt of the joke by American-made-media for too long. And now the joke is on citizens. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLORLINES.COM UPDATE: Common Application Director of Outreach Scott Anderson has confirmed to Colorlines that no changes have been made to their widely-used college application. “The Common Application has not made any announcement regarding undocumented students,” said Anderson. Anderson also confirmed that despite a splashy announcement to that effect made at a higher education conference by a person claiming to be named Daniel Vargas claiming to be employed by the organization, “There is no one named Daniel Vargas on our staff or Board of Directors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the changes is a hoax. Late Tuesday activists revealed that Daniel Vargas is in fact David Ramirez, an undocumented immigrant and activist. Ramirez addressed participants at the National Conference on Race and Ethnicity in Higher Education last week posing as a representative of the 35-year-old organization. Ramirez also claimed to be the communications director for the organization in a press release, which included a fabricated quote from Killion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VOXXI also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voxxi.com/common-application-undocumented-hoax/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released a correction&lt;/a&gt; early this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late Tuesday the Common Application was forced to reply. Rob Killion, Executive Director of the Common Application, stated: &amp;#8216;There is nothing [new to share] about the way the Common App has approached undocumented students,&amp;#8217; and explained that undocumented students continue to be excluded from the organization’s non-discrimination clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;VIDEO TRANSCRIPT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DANIEL VARGAS: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It is an honor to be here at NCORE. Today is a historic day and it is fitting for this moment to take place at this conference. Represented here today are faculty and administrators from some of the most prestigious colleges across the country, many of which are members of the Common Application. The Common Application and NCORE share a commitment to the values of equality, integrity, and access within American higher education.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am here today to announce two changes to the Common Application that will greatly increase college access for an entire community. But before I reveal what the future has in store, I need to address the past. Not too long ago, it was brought to our attention that we, The Common Application, were not upholding our own values. Today we apologize to the undocumented American community for years of discrimination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Every year thousands of undocumented students learn what it fully means to be undocumented when they realize that they have a 5% chance of attending college. Yes, according to one study, currently only 5% of undocumented youth ever attend college. A key reason for this is because private colleges unfairly and inaccurately label undocumented Americans as &amp;#8220;international,&amp;#8221; which guarantees them a separate and unequal admissions process. This practice has been permitted and facilitated by the Common Application- until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Today I&amp;#8217;m here to announce that the upcoming Common Application is taking the necessary steps to make sure that all students, including undocumented students are treated fairly when it comes to college admissions. The updated demographics section will include the term &amp;#8220;undocumented American,&amp;#8221; allowing these students to better self-identify. We are also updating our non-discrimination clause to include &amp;#8220;undocumented status.&amp;#8221; This will ban admissions discrimination at over 400 colleges nationwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;In the coming days, people will call this change many things. But we gathered here know that equality is not radical but is common sense; and the undocumented American community, which is represented here today, knows that this change could not come soon enough. So for both NCORE and the Common App, our commitment to equality, integrity, and college access cannot end here. Indeed, this is where it begins. I encourage everyone here with twitter to take a second using the #UndocuEquality to show and voice your support for this change. Furthermore, I encourage all of you to help lead your institutions in welcoming this change and more importantly- in welcoming these students. &lt;span&gt;Thank you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Nyusha Samiei&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Still of floating lilies from Iranian poet Forough Farrokhzad&#39;s film The House Is Black; subtitle reads, remember that my life is wind&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/e4063d7ba53180cc38411c59ba94ef0c/tumblr_inline_mnvtfzr6WT1qz4rgp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: Reflection of trees in a pond. Text: Remember that my life is wind.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting on a bridge as I write this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It has been a long year. Amidst the exhausting work we do, I wonder if we notice the silent revolutions we experience.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am back home for the summer, and I am sitting on a bridge overlooking the bay where I grew up.  Memories of my childhood fill my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I account for changes between my present-day self and my childhood self. Through these transitions, I yearn for some answer, some great truth to life. Things seem graver now than they used to be, but I know I must think with a sense of resilience in order to be involved in any personal change or meaningful resistance.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have different ways of measuring the past, of measuring endings and beginnings. Ultimately, these units of measure serve to qualify our personal growth. Each new year is a moment to reflect, much like the ending of each school year. As a diasporic individual, I am graced with two new years each year (perhaps I am doubly self-reflective).&lt;!-- more --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norooz&lt;/em&gt; - New Year according to the Iranian Calendar - falls symbolically on the first day of spring. This past &lt;em&gt;Norooz&lt;/em&gt;, as with every other, my grandfather pulled out &lt;em&gt;Divan-e Hafez&lt;/em&gt;, an anthology of the Iranian poet &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafez&quot; title=&quot;Hafez on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hafez&lt;/a&gt;’s poems. The tradition is to open the book at random and the chosen poem is your prophesy. My grandfather read a poem for me: it was about the wind. An ancient Iranian poet advised from the grave that, through it all, I should allow my heart to be like the wind, to allow sorrow and joy to pass through me like the wind. Towards the end of the year, when I grew obsessed with Iranian poet &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forough_Farrokhzad&quot; title=&quot;Forough on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forough Farrokhzad&lt;/a&gt;, I watched her film &lt;em&gt;The House is Black&lt;/em&gt;. The movie shows lepers living in abjection, quarantined from society. We hear Farrokhzad’s voice narrating lines from Biblical and Islamic texts, as well as her own poetry. One line struck me: “Remember that my life is wind.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit by the bridge, as the wind passes by me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I often think of this theme. I think of the transience of things, how our identities are hybrid and fluid. What bothers me about this idea of wind is that we yearn for something with teeth, something to hold on to.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to my high school in order to write this.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been four years. I hardly relate to myself.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to capture an image as I walk up the hill to the secluded school in the forest—how does space affect us? When I return, which part of me is ignited? Can I recreate the same feelings associated with the memory? Will I ever feel confident in that same way again? Will I find refuge in the security of that school system? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I am very blatant about my insecurities and shortcomings; perhaps this is not wise. Sometimes I think that through the performing of insecurity, displaying and dissecting it through various platforms and conversations, we are purged of it. I think of Susan Sontag (although she was more reserved in openly displaying her insecurities): “I&amp;#8217;m only interested in people engaged in a project of self-transformation.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I had the chance to speak with one of my favourite high school teachers. As I waited, a student asked me, “Are you in grade 12?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, actually I just finished my 4th year of university.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh wow, I’m in grade 11. Is university harder? Is it better?”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is university better? What is it like?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of Nyusha in high school&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/3dfefcd43fc859cbbf5b262e582798e3/tumblr_inline_mnvwjtbg4y1qz4rgp.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Photo of Nyusha in high school&quot;/&gt;[Photo: Nyusha sitting on a flight of stairs. The stairs have shoes lined up neatly on each step.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was in high school I remember students who had just finished their first year of college would return and share stories. “It is so much better. It gets so much better.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they failed to mention was that college is a terribly lonely place. For the first time, you are confronted directly with solitude and your own company. For some this is a blessing—a chance to move past the restrictions of high school. For others, this is far from the truth. I witnessed some people fall into a sort of fatalism. Others retreated into hopelessness. Cynicism was in fashion. The worst was indifference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I hardly understand What Life is About, and who does in their early twenties? I did learn a few lessons, though.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, kindness is regenerative. My mother tells me the story of calling her father in tears about experiencing xenophobia after being displaced to France following the revolution. At the end of their long conversations, he would say, “Be good and kind, &lt;em&gt;joonam&lt;/em&gt;. You cannot change others, but you can choose to be good.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I think of college and how often I have felt angry or lonely or mean. And how this bitterness sublimated into my daily actions (I had this thought as I drank morning coffee—&lt;em&gt;talkh&lt;/em&gt;, or bitter, in Farsi). It took a while to notice that kindness was necessary Now because cruelty was always possible Later (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Holzer&quot; title=&quot;Jenny Holzer on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny Holzer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Survival Series&lt;/em&gt;, 1983 - 1985). Really, what I wanted to say to this student was that the transition from high school to college would absolutely be difficult. Perhaps your support system from high school has dispersed. The empty signifiers of popularity have disappeared and you remain weightless: now it is up to you to situate yourself politically, aesthetically, ethically, socially. You spend long stretches of time doing work that seems fruitless. You do things last minute. You find serenity in routine and creativity in chaos. Every now and then you have brief moments of “Wow, this is what it’s all about.” And sometimes these revelations occur weekly and lose their poignancy.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could have relayed the lessons I had learned, which were painfully aphoristic in nature, and hidden in private experiences:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work Hard / Ask for Help / Put Fear Aside / Stay in Touch / Drink Water and Eat Well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But really, in the moment, all I could say was, “College is what you make of it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? That was all I could think of?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for many of us is that we live in a world without easy answers. Personally, I regularly face the violent disjuncture between homeland, memory, and the body. My heart is torn across continents, and I forget different parts of myself when I am away for too long. Language wounds me, and I cannot explain myself completely coherently in any one of them. Miscommunication muffles the desperation behind profound issues, and we dismiss one another too easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the end, I find brief pockets of calm &lt;span&gt;— &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;here next to the bridge by home, with my old high school teacher, or reading poetry with my grandfather. And I think&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;tend to these moments as much as you can now and you will be rewarded with witnessing your growth and feeling at peace. This will create the energy you will need later on to contribute to important projects. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All I really wanted to say was: &lt;em&gt;you will be unaware in the moment, but suffering accompanies understanding, as hard work accompanies comfort, eventually you will let go of cynicism like the wind, and somehow through it all, through your project of radical self-transformation, the world will unfurl at your feet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yo&lt;span&gt;u can k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eep &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Nyusha Samiei on Twitter @nyushii&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (June 3, 12:32 AM):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have a new piece written by one of the Gezi Park occupiers, Lara Fresko:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This morning the city seemed quiet and rain was falling as if to clean the trees of tear-gas. What seems most hopeful is that such a mobilization was triggered by a will to protect Gezi Parkı. People from all walks of life came to support each other against police brutality and violence. This solidarity in the face of police violence symbolized the materialization of a discontent against neoliberalism and those guarding it. The chants heard during previous nights were filled with rage against the police, the current government and especially the prime minister. They communicated outrage against growing inequality, consuming, painful urban transformation and a total disregard for democratic values of participation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undocuqueer activist illustrator Julio Salgado discusses his political progression from painting a picture perfect portrait of undocumented students to a framework that recognizes even if your record isn&amp;#8217;t squeaky clean, you don&amp;#8217;t deserve to be deported. &lt;span&gt;Highlights include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;a date with a gay Latino Republican,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;using art to combat fatphobia and body-hatred,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How the Colombian Student Movement Won - {young}ist</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/how-the-colombian-student-movement-won</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Preorg. Cross-posted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://preorg.org/howthecolombianstudentmovementwon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;preorg.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/cad79d3bfc8a2008ab55236d404b10ea/tumblr_inline_mnj7zpxeiU1qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: A Colombian student pokes a giant pencil at a line of riot gear-donned police officers.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the Colombian government proposed a sweeping marketization program for the Colombian higher education system, including allowing private capital to invest in public universities. Students across the country rose up to fight the proposals. By the end of the year the protests against the reform had forced the government to abandon their plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many campaigns against university marketization and privatization in other countries have struggled in the face of an overwhelmingly neoliberal global political climate, I was interested to find out what the Colombian student movement had done to beat the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the student movement was an organization called MANE, so I spoke to Boris Duarte, one of their spokespeople.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duarte, along with many other students, became involved in the fight over education in Colombia in 2005 when the government proposed a set of academic reforms that established a system of valuations and credits that many felt had little to do with quality education and followed a neoliberalizing logic. This battle was lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Duarte became a member of one of Colombia’s big national student organizations, Identitad Estudiantil. In 2007 they fought against government plans to cut academic budgets. This campaign was partially successful in defending budgets but the students failed to get everything they had demanded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the attacks on academia by Colombia’s solidly neoliberal government just kept coming, some students started to discuss a broader organizational approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In 2008 a group of five national student organizations started to approach the necessity of creating a qualitative leap in our ability to work together and respond to proposals from the government,” explained Duarte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to go beyond responding in an ad hoc way to these proposals and changes that were clearly going to keep coming. So we had three goals: to create greater unity of political action, the construction of a political strategy against the neoliberal educational model, and to move forward in organizational terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These five national student organizations expressed five differing political tendencies on the Colombian left, with the usual history of sectarian bickering this implies, so getting them to work together was no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between 2008 and 2010 we had a lot of discussions in the student movement to develop strategies for mobilization that would enable us to organize ourselves better,” said Duarte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That simple sentence covers three years of work. It demonstrates a patience in organizing that I have never seen in the UK. I like the word that Colombians often use to talk about organizing: instead of talking about an organization they talk about a ‘process’. Though an everyday word here it seems to me to imply something dynamic rather than static, a process that changes those involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those three years the different organizations were not just working between themselves, said Duarte, but were also working outside universities, in schools, in neighborhoods, to get other people involved in the student movement. He sees this as a key factor when the big moment arrived: “people outside of academia got involved in a big way in the strikes and protests as a result of these three years of work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 the students faced the first attempt at education reform by the government of former President Uribe. It sought to fundamentally change the method of financing universities to link financing to GDP and to marketize the system. In the end Uribe didn’t have the ability or time to press his changes through, but the campaign to neoliberalize the universities was carried forward by his successor President Santos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Santos began to prepare his plans to present to the country in 2011 the radical nature of the program became clear: he proposed the opening of universities to private capital, a change in the evaluation standards to make the universities fit a model of ‘productivity’, and a cut in budgets and restructuring of financing in order to make universities dependent on private money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the students began to make their own plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A national meeting was called at the beginning of 2011, and this meeting aimed to transform the student movement into something in which people beyond the student movement could become a part, whether sports teams, cultural collectives, artists, academics, public and private institutions, technical colleges,” said Duarte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mesa-Amplia-Nacional-Estudiantil-MANE-Colombia/243604319024561&quot; title=&quot;MANE Facebook page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mesa Amplia Nacional Estudantil&lt;/a&gt;, or MANE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANE had a dual-pronged strategy. They were going to strike, and strike as hard as they could, but they also wanted to offer to the country their vision of what education should be. To this end a major part of the MANE project was the construction of a Minimal Program, a set of demands to the government expressing the minimum with which they would be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a ‘minimal’ program in the sense that many of those involved in its construction were revolutionary socialists of various stripes and in some other Colombia would wish for a much more radicalized education system. But what they demanded now was simple, comprehensible across the political spectrum, and listed in six points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Free education, paid for by the state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Administrative autonomy and democratization of academia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greater provision for student welfare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High quality education&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to exercise democratic freedoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A socially engaged academia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this minimal program we got a huge response from people across the country,” said Duarte, who believes that the broad appeal of the program helped to defeat the government’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minimal Program, and any other formal decision or position of the MANE, were put to the country by spokespeople like Duarte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job of the spokespeople was to voice the MANE program and if any of them went beyond this in official interviews they could be relieved of their positions. Internally they were allowed to express views different to the Minimal Program and other consensus ideas of the national committee, but externally it was their job to give voice to MANE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aside here on the organization form of the MANE, and in the present tense, for the organization is still going. The organization is run by the national committee, which is composed of delegates from every university. The delegates are chosen by assemblies at each university and the number of delegates from each institution is weighted according to it size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the committee that chooses the spokespeople, and can deselect them if necessary. It also sets up various ancillary committees such as one for communication strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all of this was in place by the time President Santos formally set out his proposals in the middle of 2011. The MANE immediately called a series of national days of action. On each occasion about 32 public universities went into strike, with support from some private universities who didn’t strike but supported the campaign, and support on the street extending beyond the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Duarte:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We convoked 3 or 4 national days of action. It caused a lot of disruption so it obviously made the national news. We had a group of official spokespeople across the country – that was very important. After a big day of cultural action on the 10th October the reform came to be seen as an antidemocratic move and was withdrawn from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds very simple when you put it like that, but he is careful to underline that the important bit is the three years of organizing that went before. This was a major reform proposal early in a government’s term that had a lot of backing within the government ranks. It was the student movement and only the student movement that stopped it happening. Colombia’s public universities remain public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duarte’s use of the term ‘cultural’ interested me. The images of the Colombian student protests that went around the world were indeed artistic, and interestingly – for a country that has clandestine protest groups dedicated to fighting the police – seemed to be mostly peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if there had been a decision to use peaceful tactics only. The answer was no, it was just that the movement had been conceived as a cultural movement, prioritizing artistic expression, and had made links with the world beyond academia. In this context violence on the street hadn’t made sense. There were isolated incidents of it but they were rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We generated so much support from the general population that it was much more difficult to repress us,” said Duarte. “Rather than a non-violent movement, it was a democratic movement. We wanted it to be for all of society, not just for students. So this was just what people wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now a couple of years since their victory so I asked what MANE is doing now. Duarte is optimistic about the future of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our main complaints in 2011 was that the government was failing to consult people, they kept changing education without any democratic mandate. So since then we have been constructing an alternative proposal, democratic and including people from across Colombia. Today we have a proposal for a law to reform education that we will present to the people on June of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing we have been doing is strengthening the MANE in the regions. In 2011 a lot of the actions happened in Bogota. Now our organizational methods have improved and we have a more solid structure in the regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the MANE process will be maintained for as long as it is a useful way to exert a continuous influence on higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duarte has a few last words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we want to make clear to the people abroad that this is not democratic government in Colombia. We live in a repressive political system that doesn’t allow participation. We in contrast want a new education for sovereignty, democracy and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is indeed a huge amount of repression of the left in Colombia and it makes little sense to see the country as a functioning democracy. All the more impressive then that, when in so many countries the battles to save education from neoliberalization have been lost, the Colombian students won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can keep &lt;span&gt;up with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Preorg on Twitter @bedresistance &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Behind the scenes of the st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;udent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; struggle to preserve one of America&amp;#8217;s last remaining free universities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Saar Shemesh &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/013ac77f083472355bde20acc689d96d/tumblr_inline_mnhlkqdgNG1rkj9dw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: Two students looking out two separate windows of the President of Cooper Union&amp;#8217;s large office. A big painting of Peter Cooper, the founder of the school, hangs on the wall in between the two windows.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/inside-the-cooper-union-occupations-first-hours/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, May 8, at exactly 11:00 a.m., about forty Cooper Union students and I waltzed through the doors of the president’s office. We turned on our webcams and began live streaming. We appointed people to keep the entrances and exits open, and we read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://cusos.org/students-take-presidents-office/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement of intent&lt;/a&gt; to the camera and the administrators who were present. They were caught completely off-guard; within minutes, we had over 100 students filling the office space. Our president, Jamshed Bharucha was nowhere to be found − though he says his doors are always open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was 19 days ago. Or 463 hours. To me, it feels more like the latter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;photo of students sitting-in&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/f28b6b3f8a0c5a23c8e7952481bb322b/tumblr_inline_mnhlk6e1c41rkj9dw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: Nearly 30 students sit on the floor of the President&amp;#8217;s office with their arms linked.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time students have taken space at Cooper Union. Just this past December, a group of 11 art students &lt;a href=&quot;http://cusos.org/students-for-a-free-cooper-union-lock-in-to-cooper-unions-foundation-building-to-preserve-free-education-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;locked themselves&lt;/a&gt; inside the Peter Cooper Suite for an entire week using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4695807025528&amp;amp;;set=a.4695806785522.176722.1004640217&amp;amp;;type=3&amp;amp;;theater&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;barricades&lt;/a&gt; they had built in our own school-wide sculpture shop. Back then, our demands seemed like distant goals: that the administration reaffirm its belief in free higher education, that the board of trustees restructure itself to be more accountable and transparent to the Cooper community, and that President Bharucha step down. In this current occupation, I see those as immediate goals on which to campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has changed since the December lock-in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, the board of trustees pulled a power play to get the art faculty to concede to the tuition model. Using unprecedented authority over admissions, the board &lt;a href=&quot;http://cusos.org/student-rally-and-press-conference-for-deferred-early-decision-applicants/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sent deferred acceptance letters&lt;/a&gt; to everyone who had applied early decision to the School of Art − forcing the hitherto resistant faculty to sign-off on instituting tuition at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semester had just started and we were caught off-guard, bumbling around our studios and classes like chickens with our heads cut off, and feeling that our collective artistic body was on the chopping block too. We had small actions, but no cohesive campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 23, Board of Trustees Chairman Mark Epstein &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/23/cooper-union-tuition_n_3140968.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a public forum – distastefully held in Cooper Union’s Great Hall, where in 1860 President Lincoln delivered his “Right Makes Might” anti-slavery speech – that, beginning in the fall of 2014, Cooper Union would start charging tuition for the first time in 154 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were beside ourselves. The board of trustees had dropped this big news on students just as the semester was about to end, catching us at the onset of finals (arguably the most stressful point in our semester). We &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/nyregion/cooper-union-to-charge-undergraduates-tuition.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;;_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hugged the Foundation building&lt;/a&gt; and held a &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyperallergic.com/69569/cooper-union-students-react-to-drastic-tuition-increase/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;candlelight vigil&lt;/a&gt; where we shared memories of a free Cooper Union. But again, we were trudging along, shocked that the administration had finally dared to announce tuition, our worst-case scenario, after we had been campaigning for transparency in Cooper’s operations for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/b1e2f7a4d110ca960796df8dd1865bb7/tumblr_inline_mnhljjCy211rkj9dw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: Students sitting on the floor of the President&amp;#8217;s office. The students are having a meeting.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 8 we began to hold the office space, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cusos.org/55-hours/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exclaiming&lt;/a&gt; that it was “no longer the Office of the President, but an Office for Over 100 Presidents from the Cooper Community.” We chose to occupy the president’s office to show how we could make the space function for the institution better than had Bharucha – literally taking hold of the hub of the administration at Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an insider, it’s hard to tell what came first: our plans or our actions. As an organizer, I crave particular structures (albeit loose ones) with which to run a campaign, so the smattering of unplanned actions at Cooper would typically worry or frustrate me. However, this style of organizing seems to work for us here, like no other group that I have organized within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of us are not versed in direct action tactics or organizing strategy, and have somewhat of an allergic reaction to structure-heavy organizing. However, we have a certain type of loose structure that lends itself well to action-heavy organizing, and that has made both the lock-in last semester and the current occupation very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, there are three tiers of involvement: activists, organizers and Organizers. No single tier is better than another nor can function without the other two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Activists are the students who come out to actions, but have no direct hand in planning them. They are passionate, in short bursts, and they are extremely important when showing the administration we are not just a small group of occupiers. Instead, activists demonstrate that they are part of a support system of concerned, enraged students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Small-o] organizers are the students who not only come out to actions, but have also gone to all or a majority of the meetings leading up to an action and have committed themselves to some level of preparation for an action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;[Big-o] Organizers are the students who are more invested in making sure the behind-the-scenes are arranged in a cohesive way, and are constantly thinking of the answer to the question, “what’s next?” – even in the middle of an action. [Big-o] Organizers know that if we’re not constantly thinking of actions in terms of a string of connected actions, with tactics and strategies, then we are simply organizing action-to-action, and support for our cause and movement is not growing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within our group, Organizers make up the smallest group, and are generally outweighed by the will of the organizing-body that works on a looser structural basis. What’s great is that mostly everyone in the activist and organizer tiers are willing to do a whole lot at the drop of a hat—with just the prompt of a Celly message—to ensure the group’s safety in numbers or the drop of a banner. What I’ve realized in the last three weeks (half spent in occupation, and half spent planning for it) is that our group as a whole does not like [big-o] Organizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lock-in during December, many of us realized we had to try and get everyone familiar with a certain type of organizing framework. Collectively, we established a spokescouncil – that would have ideally functioned like that of Occupy Wall Street – in which working groups would meet regularly and report back to each other either via representatives once a week, or through meetings coordinated on an as-needed basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To execute the spokescouncil efficiently we used Google Groups and Google Docs; this made organizing our actions into longer strategic campaigns much easier. However, with the exception of the “Organizers,” most of the group found this laborious and attendance dropped off rapidly. My fellow students were constantly lamenting that we were spending critical time on creating elaborate internal structures and not actually planning anything (read: actions). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good strategy is important to me because without it even well planned actions fall flat. Without some form of escalation, campaign, or action sequencing we don’t build power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good strategy includes having clear goals (a free, accessible and transparent Cooper Union), identifying your allies and your constituents, targeting someone who can give you what you want (President Bharucha and the board of trustees), then deploying tactics that can get you closer to achieving your goals (petitioning the student and faculty bodies for a vote of “no confidence” and a open, rolling occupation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, long-term strategy minded Organizers are the minority in our group and, perhaps because we failed to communicate why strategy was so crucial to everyone else, a misconception pervaded the group that action-based tactics were synonymous with strategic campaigning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over winter break, we held facilitation trainings. In the spring, not only did more people show up, but now we also had trained leadership that could facilitate meetings in a non-hierarchical manner. Before we had tactics, now we could forge strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, most Cooper students involved in the occupation were “activists,” and many of them were hesitant about strategic Organizing or even disdainful of it. It makes sense; only a few of us have experience from Occupy or other social justice movements. We’re college students who believe in our school and the sanctity of free higher education. And we’re occupying because we think it will help us protect that. But that doesn’t mean that long-term strategic Organizing will come naturally to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of people’s hesitation for devising strategies within an agreed upon structure, we’ve so far been able to get by on our antics and actions. Although we never formally met as a large group to discuss what would become of our occupation after the last day of school (which was last Wednesday), we met organically in smaller groups and decided that we aimed to stay. For the last week or so, we’ve become a fluid group of about thirty rotating students all committed to holding this space for the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting organically allows for us to have leaders at any given time, tethering us closer to the non-hierarchy we aim to enact. Already people are planning to sublet their apartments on account of their new residences being the president’s office.  Without formally talking about it, we began to carve out the office into different zones; food pantry, backpacks and belongings, banners/signs, collective bedding, space for work, and space for play. When it gets messy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://discardstudies.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/cooper-union-student-protest-cleaning-up-their-school/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we start cleaning&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not a big to-do. We have started compiling a calendar, and day-by-day people add events to the blackboard, noting when we’ll have guest speakers come to hang out with us. A projector has been procured, and we are starting to screen movies at night. In the end, all of these structures came out of the lack of formal meetings from folks who shared a common strategic Organizing mindset.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/e3dd397077ae1a17dbc0b1cf3e46858c/tumblr_inline_mnhmf4zS1j1rkj9dw.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Photo: A banner unravels from a window at the front of a Cooper Union building.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that for most Cooper occupiers, [big-o] Organizing feels stuffy, and burdensome – whereas [little-o] organizing feels exciting, fresh and free. Given the choices available to most college students, it’s no surprise that creative young minds would prefer to organize themselves in a seemingly looser structure – and Cooper is no exception. I think our compromise is a good one: we each hold a long-term strategic framework in our heads, but we eschew the more formalized structures that turn our fellow students off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been able to keep approximately twenty-five people in this office at any given time, and even with people leaving the city for the summer, we have begun visioning activities well into the summer to keep momentum high. Loose plans for a ‘disorientation’, or ‘re-orientation’ for incoming freshman are being organized for the Fall, and we are working on strengthening our network with other schools in NYC to ensure that what we are beginning to build at Cooper does not die out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me the better part of a year to adjust to the Cooper “style” of organizing – but I continue to learn more about myself as an organizer (and an Organizer) in the process of helping to sustain, with the rest of my classmates and fellow occupiers, a budding student movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;u can&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; keep up with Saar on &lt;a href=&quot;http://saarshemesh.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What does it take to organize across class lines? In the context of a nationwide revival of both labor struggles and student movements, students and workers at college campuses are increasingly having to find out. At Columbia University, students recently started to back a group of Faculty House workers who are fighting for a new contract. But what does solidarity mean at a university where students pay up to $60,000 a year, while campus workers can barely make ends meet?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the spring semester ends and elected officials approach critical votes, students across the country are rising up to take back public education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Chicago Students Stage Citywide Boycott to Protest School Closings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, May 20, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/csosos?fref=ts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chicago Students Organizing to Save Our Schools&lt;/a&gt; organized a citywide boycott so that students could join a three-day march in protest of school closures. More than two hundred students participated from high schools across the city. In the morning, students met at Williams Elementary, which the &lt;a href=&quot;http://teacherunderconstruction.com/2013/05/21/what-i-learned-in-chicago/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;school system ordered&lt;/a&gt; to be put on lockdown. From there, we marched three miles downtown, where 26 activists were occupying City Hall in an act of civil disobedience. The action ended with a large rally at Daley Plaza, with speakers ranging from teachers union president &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9J-3UvsBGs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karen Lewis&lt;/a&gt; to third grader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;;v=oue9HIOM7xU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asean Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. On May 22, as activists occupied the central lobby, Chicago’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blog/174478/rahm-emanuels-zombie-pigs-vs-chicagos-angry-birds&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unelected board of education&lt;/a&gt; voted to close 50 schools. Students and allies are overwhelmingly upset—but the fight for these schools is not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Israel Muñoz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. After Thousands Walk Out, Philly Student Union Heads to Chicago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was one of the 2,000 Philadelphia students who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blog/174401/what-you-should-know-about-philly-student-walkout&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;walked out of school&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, May 17, to assert a student voice in the face of school closings and disinvestment. By Saturday, I was in Chicago joining the struggle against school closings there. Chicago’s closings, like Philadelphia’s, are primarily in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=365867390185445&amp;amp;;set=a.365867380185446.1073741829.206725559432963&amp;amp;;type=1&amp;amp;;theater&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; black and Latino neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;. After marching through the north, west and south sides of the city, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/wbez/reps-from-the-philadelphia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spoke alongside students&lt;/a&gt; from Chicago at Daley Plaza. Next, we marched and held hands around City Hall—where teachers and community members were arrested for sitting in. Students from Philly, Boston, Baltimore and Detroit came to support Chicago’s fight. As students, we will continue fighting in every city until we have the schools we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Sharron Snyder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Sparked by the LAPD, USC Mobilizes Against Racial Profiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 4, the Los Angeles Police Department deployed 79 officers in riot gear to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN-Sz6NKGyI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;shut down a peaceful graduation celebration&lt;/a&gt; attended primarily by black and Latino students at the University of Southern California. Nine student leaders were arrested, six spent the night in police custody and others were herded off the block and physically assaulted. Charges against arrested students are still pending and await court proceedings on May 30. This incident, along with a string of similar happenings, sparked what has become known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23uschangemovement&amp;amp;;src=hash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#USChangeMovement&lt;/a&gt;. On May 6, more than 200 students, faculty and local residents &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKplG-32GCk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sat-in&lt;/a&gt; at Tommy Trojan to protest and exchange stories of discrimination and racial profiling at USC and in the greater Los Angeles area. On May 7, &lt;a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/James/Documents/more%20than%201,000%20people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 1,000 people&lt;/a&gt; attended an on-campus discussion with students, the LAPD, the USC Department of Public Safety, the HR Commission and USC senior administration members to seek answers and draft joint solutions. USC students are propelling citywide movement to end racial profiling, excessive force and selective law enforcement—all while embracing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscchangemovement.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peace, intellect and understanding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—USChangeMovement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. In South LA, Students Defend Community Schools&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2012, Crenshaw High School received notice from LA superintendent John Deasy that &lt;a href=&quot;http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/01/15/community-protests-lausds-plan-to-convert-crenshaw-high-into-magnet-school/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the school would undergo a “transformation”&lt;/a&gt; starting this summer. Under the transformation, more than half of Crenshaw’s teachers—many of whom are older, black or active in the union—have been rejected from returning. The conversion of Crenshaw into three magnets means students have to reapply—likely pushing many out. This move comes at a time when Crenshaw has been showing improvements through its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.labornotes.org/2012/12/los-angeles-wants-reconstitute-pioneering-high-school-despite-major-gains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;innovative Extended Learning Cultural Model&lt;/a&gt;, which prioritizes culturally relevant education and project-based learning. Connecting Crenshaw with recent upheaval at other black and Latino high schools in South LA, the Crenshaw community has been organizing against the transformation. As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/cej.la&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coalition for Educational Justice&lt;/a&gt;, Taking Action and the school&amp;#8217;s Sierra Club, we’ve given presentations and developed a survey to ask our fellow students about their experiences at the school. The data from the 500 students we’ve collected will be presented at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;;pid=gmail&amp;amp;;attid=0.1&amp;amp;;thid=13ec8750c8726786&amp;amp;;mt=application/pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a forum on May 28&lt;/a&gt; for students to voice their opinions about school transformations all over South LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. In Sacramento, Trans Justice Hits the Senate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 29, dozens of Gay-Straight Alliance club activists joined together in Sacramento for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gsanetwork.org/news/blog/queer-youth-advocacy-day-2013/05/08/13&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Queer Youth Advocacy Day&lt;/a&gt; to rally for middle schools and high schools where all students can succeed. We spoke to legislators about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/5636&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;School Success and Opportunity Act&lt;/a&gt; (AB 1266), which makes sure California schools know that transgender students have the full right to participate in all school programs. Students shared their experiences of how not being included with students of the gender they identify with can have disastrous consequences such as forcing them to drop out of school. Others talked about school districts that do allow them to participate fully, like LA Unified, which shows that implementation of this bill is possible and positive experiences can come from it. The bill has now passed through the assembly and is headed for the senate, where we will continue to advocate to keep all students in school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Keanan Gottlieb and Logan Henderson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Across California, Students Put the School Police State on Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When students in California have problems like not getting to class on time, fighting or breaking school rules, schools handle these situations with suspensions, expulsions, and school police tickets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alternet.org/education/where-are-student-voices-gun-control-debate?paging=off&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that hit youth of color hardest&lt;/a&gt;. For the past five years in LA, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.communityrightscampaign.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Community Rights Campaign&lt;/a&gt; has built a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestrategycenter.org/node/5909&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;student movement&lt;/a&gt; that organizes on buses, in our neighborhoods and at city hall and the school district board. We led a fight against the top school police citation—$250 truancy and tardy tickets—and won &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/CzGVBoNUWjo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big changes&lt;/a&gt; to that policy last year. We have now joined with other youth and community groups, allies and advocates across the state around a new legislative agenda. Last year we passed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestrategycenter.org/node/6049&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five bills&lt;/a&gt; to reform zero tolerance policies. This year, in response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestrategycenter.org/node/6051&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post-Newtown push&lt;/a&gt; for more police in schools, we are trying to pass &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestrategycenter.org/node/6050&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AB 549&lt;/a&gt;, a bill that would help limit the role of police in school districts and prioritize funding for counselors, intervention workers and other mental health services. The bill will be headed for a full assembly floor vote if it clears its final committee hearing this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Carlos Elmo Gomez&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Investments on Check at Middlebury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nakba Day&lt;/a&gt;, in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;http://972mag.com/photos-palestinians-commemorate-nakba-day-in-rallies-and-protests/71551/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;global demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; for Palestinian rights, a coalition including Palestinian, Israeli, and American Jewish students &lt;a href=&quot;http://wagingnonviolence.org/2013/05/middlebury-students-stage-israeli-checkpoint-to-push-divestment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;staged a checkpoint&lt;/a&gt; at Middlebury to call on the college to divest from companies doing business with Israel. At Middlebury, &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.middlebury.edu/jfp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justice for Palestine&lt;/a&gt; has united with an array of campus groups, including environmentalists calling for the college to divest from fossil-fuel companies, to make the call. Politicized by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://middbeat.org/2013/05/14/trustees-chose-not-to-vote-on-divestment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trustees’ failure&lt;/a&gt; to honor their initial commitment to vote on divestment in May, students are refusing to budge from an intersectional analysis of oppression in divestment organizing—for which four students were &lt;a href=&quot;http://middleburycampus.com/article/arrested-students-protest-environmental-racism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrested in March&lt;/a&gt; and five were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7dvt.com/2012why-middlebury-college-put-five-students-trial-over-dalai-lama-prank&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nearly expelled in the fall&lt;/a&gt;—and are gearing up for escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Jay Saper&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. A New Union at Penn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 28, after a year of planning and relationship building, subcontracted dining hall workers at the University of Pennsylvania went public with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://justiceonthemenu.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justice on the Menu&lt;/a&gt; campaign, demanding higher wages and more paid sick days. Alongside student allies in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pennslap.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Penn Student Labor Action Project&lt;/a&gt;, workers held a large &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/03/dining-hall-workers-share-common-struggles-at-rally&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rally&lt;/a&gt; in March, launched a website and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;;v=hXdncHtJVEw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and were featured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/04/bon-appetit-employee-speaks-out-respectfully&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;almost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/04/dining-hall-workers-empowered-by-justice-on-the-menu-movement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weekly&lt;/a&gt; in the campus newspaper this spring. Students also collected over 1,100 signatures in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://justiceonthemenu.com/petition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; delivered to University President Amy Gutmann. The semester ended with a successful unionization process with Teamsters Local 929 for workers at Falk Dining Commons. As contract negotiations take place in the coming months, students and workers will continue pushing for improved job standards and working conditions on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. How Long Will Sallie Mae Profit Off Student Debt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 9, twenty students from the United States Student Association, the Student Labor Action Project and allied organizations met with US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to discuss the DOE&amp;#8217;s relationship with Sallie Mae, the largest private owner of student debt in the country. Sallie Mae made $84 million in profit on federal loan servicing contracts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studentlabor.org/2013/05/17/the-top-10-things-you-dont-know-about-sallie-mae/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last year alone&lt;/a&gt;. The students came to the table to pressure Secretary Duncan to break Sallie Mae&amp;#8217;s contract or incentivize the companies processing federal loans to enroll debtors in programs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-based&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Income Based Repayment&lt;/a&gt; that prioritize helping people with student debt get back on their feet. On May 30, students from across the country are &lt;a href=&quot;http://afl.salsalabs.com/o/4023/c/48/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=7062&amp;amp;;track=2013MAY30_slapfb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;going to Sallie Mae&amp;#8217;s shareholder meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Newark, Delaware. We plan to pressure Sallie Mae to open up about their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prwatch.org/files/TFPTF.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relationship with ALEC&lt;/a&gt; and their process for paying their top executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—John Connelly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. How Long Will Students Wait for Arne Duncan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 1 and 2, student debt advocates from across the Midwest are coming together in Chicago to discuss a national &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.workingfamiliesparty.org/2013/05/tell-congress-dont-double-student-loan-rates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;student debt &lt;/a&gt;campaign, the first of a series of regional meetings to tackle educational debt. The campaign’s focus and strategy will be hammered out this summer with participating organizations. Based on existing conversations, the initial goals and strategies revolve around a commitment to quality higher education as a public good that should be affordable and accessible to all. Three areas to advance this long-term goal include: providing support to borrowers currently paying off the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-22/student-loan-debt-reaches-record-1-trillion-u-s-report-says.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;existing $1 trillion in debt&lt;/a&gt;; addressing causes of declining affordability and quality, including changes to state funding and financial aid policies; and addressing the role of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/05/elizabeth-warren-house-republican-student-loan-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; and the growing financialization and privatization of higher education without the burden of financial hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-caption&quot;&gt;Students at Alexandria University demonstrate against the use of excessive force by security personnel. (Photo by: Ahmed Arab, via Daily News Egypt)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Taher El Moataz Bellah, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Union President at the American University in Cairo, Vice President of the Egyptian Student Union for Private Universities, and the newest addition to our team of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youngist.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;{young}ist&lt;/a&gt; contributors. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/05/12/whatever-happened-to-the-student-movement/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cross-posted from Daily News Egypt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently more than three million Egyptian students enrolled in higher education. Before the revolution, most of them dreamed of an opportunity to escape a country plagued by both corruption and nepotism. However, most of them were inclined to take a confrontational stance towards the social problems they once tried to escape. A wave of unprecedented forms of protesting in modern Egyptian history swept over campuses. Strikes, sit-ins, demonstrations, and even occupy movements became a usual sight in both public and private universities – something that was thought to be as one of the undesired outcomes of the revolution, an unnecessary new cult that would distract students from their so-called sole purpose in life, studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student unions are the only elected entities on campus, thus they are the official representatives of the student body. They used to be highly politicized until Sadat cancelled political committees, dissolved the Egyptian student union that had been composed of student unions from all Egyptian universities, and prohibited political activities on campus after he was loudly opposed by leftist students who resented the political reorientation of Egypt towards the West and regarded privatization as a prominent threat (his financial support and intentional revival of the Islamist forces to get rid of the leftist forces that greatly opposed his neoliberal policies are outside the scope of this article). Since then, candidates for the student union were prevented from running for office if they were discovered to be affiliated with the opposition. Moreover, the success of the almighty State Security forces in recruiting student union presidents as informants not only ensured the de-politicization of the universities, but has also managed to destroy the trust of the students in the sole body that is supposed to be representing them. Even though this has changed since the revolution with the introduction of a new student constitution that allows political activities and supposedly grants freedom of expression on campus, the fact that this constitution was imposed on students without being subjected to public voting is still a major concern in itself for the students who regard this act as blunt state intervention in student affairs, regardless of its intentions.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult challenge students will have to face besides the security apparatus and the gap of trust between them and the student body is the newly formed class of elitist student revolutionaries who have claimed ownership of the revolution and declared impotent marches and chants as a profession that would pave the road for their recognition. This group of students interprets the slogan “the revolution continues” as a directive to be present on the streets at all times without having a clear strategy to transform the chants into actual reforms. The problem with this new class of elite activists, who have gained their reputation from taking part in the revolution and engaging in clashes with the Ministry of Interior afterwards, is that despite their respectable tactical experience, they lack long-term strategies. Therefore, they have gradually diverted from their initial goals to the extent that the means have become a goal in and of themselves. These students, who are sometimes driven by their affiliation with political parties, prefer limited participation in student protests to ensure maximum media exposure and avoid any unnecessary clashes with the authorities – the same authorities they attack day and night on social media and through lame statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the students are ever to regain their position as vital players in the national political arena in a time marked by marginalization of youth by a highly patriarchal society, they would have to regard themselves as the seeds of the future Egyptian left. They have to have an applicable long-term strategy that builds on past experience and aims to reform educational institutions while focusing on long-term benefits. They would also have to realize that as much as they are needed to advocate for reforms on campus, they are also needed to advocate for social justice, political freedom, and economic reforms off campus, because they are the most vocal and diversified class in a society of both educated and uneducated illiterates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Jade(d)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/57c093e6dc9c09549d0ff611249e376d/tumblr_inline_mmv7wouoai1qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;So you’ve just graduated from college and you want to change the world. Good for you. The non-profit sector seems like a natural place for a justice-minded person such as yourself, and nonprofits are almost always hiring because the turnover rate is so high. But you may find the social justice industry to be… a little unjust. Here are a few tips and tricks for how to avoid being exploited by a nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t work at one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Seriously. Working at a non-profit generally involves at least some level of exploitation. (When was the last time you saw a non-profit with a union?) If this doesn’t deter you, figure out what you’re willing to give up: Is it sleep? Weekends? Seeing your friends? Most non-profit workers do not work 9-5. Working nights and weekends is common. Paid overtime is not. Non-profits tend to make you feel like if you are not willing to work 24/7 then you are not “down for the cause.” That’s bullshit. Don’t ever let anyone make you feel like you’re not “down enough” because you are not willing to sacrifice your well-being for “the movement.” People who don’t take care of themselves burn out and often become jaded and bitter. You can’t sustain “the movement” if you don’t sustain yourself.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given that working for a non-profit involves making some sacrifices, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;make sure you’re working on issues you actually care about,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; not just ones that sound like they “could be interesting.” Do you want to spend your birthday at a training about environmental impact reports? Unless you want to change the world through city planning, the answer should be no. Every job involves doing some stuff that you don’t want to do, but the boring stuff should at least be training you in some small way for the career that you actually want.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; A boundary could be, “I don’t work through my lunch break,” or “Tuesday night is for time with my kids/partner/aging parents.” It’s not always going to be possible, but seeing how hard it is to establish and maintain your boundaries may give you some sense of whether this is a job you want to be at long-term. Sometimes there is just no one else to do the work that needs to be done. Sometimes no one else wants to do the work because it’s unglamorous and that’s why they hired you, the unofficial custodian with the 4.0 GPA. If someone does have to cover for you, make sure you take them out to lunch to let them know how much you appreciate it. Hopefully, you can set boundaries without it creating more work for others. If you can’t, that speaks to the organization’s inherent unsustainability, not any personal flaws on your part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be working toward something else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Use every opportunity to network that you can. Use every opportunity to learn new skills that you have. If you meet people who have jobs that look much better than yours, take them out to coffee (preferably not during work) and ask them how they got it. Connecting with people on LinkedIn is a great way to find out who you know that works in a field that you want to work in, and who they might be able to introduce you to that can open up doors for you in that industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t beat yourself up for hating your job.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;  It’s natural to hate being exploited, even if it’s for a really good cause. Figure out what it is about your job that you hate so you’ll know how to avoid falling into the same trap next time. If you hate your job because your boss is a sadist, look for telltale signs when you go on future interviews. I had a boss tell me at my interview that I would end up doing a lot of the things that no one else wanted to do, and then laughed. It’s one thing to say, “We’re gonna give you jobs we wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole.” It’s another to cackle about it in front of me while we’re still in the interview.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If one nonprofit is not the right fit, another one might be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; There are many ways to combat whatever social ill you’re fighting. I took a job because I was passionate about racial justice only to find that doing data entry “for racial justice” still made me want to gouge my eyes out. I might have been happier at the same organization if I worked in the communications department because it would have allowed me to be a little more creative. But I would probably be much happier at an organization that actually believed that art and culture are crucial tools for the racial justice movement, because those are the things I really care about. Of course, the trick is not getting stuck doing data entry there, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;If I haven’t yet convinced you to turn around and apply for a job at Coca-Cola or Google with a shiny 401K, here are some things you should know about picking your poison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small orgs vs. big orgs &amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perks of working at a small organization:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small organizations are often less hierarchical. If you don’t like taking orders, and want to feel like your opinion matters, a small organization might be the way to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positions here tend to be less specialized. Because everyone does everything, there is often a lot of skill-sharing, which allows you to try your hand at a lot of things and find out what you like and what you are good at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Downsides of working at a small organization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Small organizations are often under-resourced. They generally offer few benefits and little pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, because everyone does everything, YOU have to do everything, whether you like it and are good at it or not. You may sometimes find yourself over your head with very little guidance or support because everyone is stretched thin. When I was just a shy nineteen-year-old working at an anti-violence nonprofit, I accompanied a woman to court to file a restraining order against her boyfriend because our Director of Victim Services was busy. At a bigger non-profit, someone in my position might say, “That’s above my pay grade,” which is nonprofit-speak for, “I am in no way qualified to do that.” At a small organization you just do it because it has to be done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perks of working at a big organization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Benefits, benefits, benefits. Usually when an organization gets to be a certain size it has to provide health care, dental care, and sometimes even vision insurance to its employees. Big organizations also tend to pay more to “attract the best talent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Big organizations tend to be more stratified. So, if you have the privilege of not being at the very bottom of the nonprofit ladder, you at least have the comfort of knowing someone else’s job sucks more than yours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Downsides of working at a big organization:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are at the bottom – and if you’re fresh out of college with a BA, you probably will be – nobody cares what you have to say, they just want you to shut up and make the coffee. It might have been your academic excellence, student leadership, and bright-eyed ambition that got you in the door, but once you’re inside, people find those qualities annoying at best and a liability at worst. If you mention your earlier achievements, people might think you think you’re better than them, or better than the job that they’ve given you. Accept the fact that you’re overqualified and shut up, or leave. Or start a brilliant side business that will eventually allow you to leave. I once worked with a guy that had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yellowdildo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;business selling yellow dildos&lt;/a&gt; on the side. True story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A lot of times at large organizations there is surprisingly little room for growth or professional development. A lot of orgs prefer to hire from outside rather than promote from within. And because everyone’s job is so specific, you may not be qualified to do anything other than what you’re already doing or learn anything more interesting for a long time. Sometimes when you ask the people above you to teach you things, they feel threatened and think that you’re out for their job. When it comes to learning new skills and tasks you have to be satisfied with the crumbs that fall off your superiors’ plates because they are often too busy to help you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;That said, you should still ask for work that interests and challenges you, especially if you’re a pro at the work you already have. Most of this is advice for how to survive in a HOSTILE non-profit environment. While most of them are dysfunctional in some way or another, some dysfunction is more benign that others. You can find good apples at nearly every organization (maybe not in your department) who can mentor you and help you get to where you want to go in your career (or at least vent with you over coffee far from the office). But be careful to whom you disclose your frustration. I confided in a co-worker that I had some social anxiety about going to my first work social event (in part because I was young, brown and queer, and most of my coworkers were older, straight, and married.) The next day I came in my boss called me out on skipping the event and knew exactly why I hadn’t come (thanks to my loose-lipped co-worker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Types of non-profits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct service:&lt;/strong&gt; These jobs are often in either charities or government agencies. They may have caseworkers trying to help individuals find jobs and housing or help them access government benefits like disability and unemployment. These kinds of jobs may put you in constant contact with people who are down on their luck in ways you can’t even imagine, and they may take it out on you. Not everyone is cut out for this, and that’s OK. You can only be around others’ trauma so much before it consumes you. That said, this work is super super crucial, and hopefully you get to see the tangible results of it every day. Occupational hazards include compassion fatigue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grassroots organizing:&lt;/strong&gt; These jobs often involve canvassing door-to-door or calling people at home to get them to come out to protests. The pay and benefits tend to be pretty meager and the hours tend to be pretty long. Plus, you need pretty thick skin to deal with the constant rejection of the people you are trying to “empower.” The plus side is that you are basically the frontline of the social justice movement, addressing the root causes of poverty and injustice by exposing them. Next to you, other non-profit workers look like a bunch of bumbling bureaucrats waiting on their next check. Occupational hazards may include jail time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediaries:&lt;/strong&gt; These organizations generally don’t deal with folks “on the ground.” Sometimes, they don’t even interface with the communities that they are trying to empower, and at worst their work can’t even be explained to a person without a college degree. If you have grown-up responsibilities, need healthcare, or no longer see getting tear-gassed as “sexy,” this might be the job for you. You will probably spend a lot of time sitting at your desk and in meetings. Community organizations will not necessarily like you. That’s OK. You’ve got your eye on the “bigger picture.” Occupational hazards may include carpal tunnel and ever-expanding buttocks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundations:&lt;/strong&gt; I have never personally reached this echelon of the non-profit hierarchy, so I’m speculating here. Foundation workers (especially grant officers) hold the purse strings in the non-profit world, so everyone will be nice to you, but they also want something from you. Foundation workers tend to be the most polished (no hoodies and jeans at work) and probably spend the most time in air-conditioning. Foundation workers are the gatekeepers who decide what issues and organizations get funded in a particular funding cycle. These decisions can often make or break an organization that hasn’t had the forethought to diversify its funding stream (a.k.a. not getting all of its money from one or two rich guys trying to avoid paying taxes). Occupational hazards may include lack of street cred.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In conclusion, if you must work at a non-profit, try to work at one that whose issues are actually close to your heart, where you like your co-workers and don’t find yourself working long hours alone (unless that’s how you roll). Before I left my old job, I thought that because I was young, queer, brown, and hardheaded, I would run into the same problems anywhere else I went. Fortunately, I was able to find a non-profit job where I felt respected, got along with my boss, and had a lot of opportunities to network and develop new skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Hopefully now that you know a few of the red flags, you can make an informed decision about who you want to sell your labor to. Or figure out how to work for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Jade(d)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Movement Mom</title>
      <link>http://youngist.github.com/clean-blog/my-movement-mom</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <author>info@youngist.org ({young}ist)</author>
      <guid>http://youngist.github.io/clean-blog/my-movement-mom</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Ngoc Loan Tran&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/18d1406e18ae04cf64ad8ec0182bdddf/tumblr_inline_mmpfvqBIkX1qz4rgp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time my mom saw me speak about social justice was on the 7&amp;#160;o’clock news. I was speaking about the effects of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell on young LGBT people looking for reflections of themselves in society. It was an important moment for my mother and I because it showed us the similarities and differences in how we were each transforming the world. Over the years, as I’ve developed my identity as an organizer, I’ve learned more about my mother’s history, and although it’s made me appreciate the vast differences in the context of our “activism,” it ultimately has made me feel like we’re a part of the same revolution—as movement moms and daughters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother grew up in Tra Vinh, Việt Nam. In the 7th grade, she quit school to work with her mother in the fields. When she was 16 years old, she moved to Sài Gòn, Việt Nam to make a living as a seamstress. She hasn’t stopped since. She was struggling with the effects of foreign military occupation and war before I was born: politicized through need to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I do organizing work with immigrant, queer and trans communities, I think about this part of my mother’s identity and it reminds me that “the struggle” is political even in just trying to survive. Often, we feel that those of us who are “political activists” have no common ground with those who aren’t. Really, we are a community together, even if some of us have no time to be “political activists” and focus more energy on “getting by” than “taking down the man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a witness to how my mother has been able to make it to through the system. I have seen all of the ways she’s been forced to bend rules and deadlines, payment plans and other bills to sustain our paycheck-to-paycheck life. And most importantly, I have seen all of the ways she never gave in and never gave up while spending all of her life being pushed around by systems that don’t work in her favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of living without much money was learning to find another source of security. My mother found that security by believing in the power of community to support her in during times of struggle. Her ability to be able to split $20 between multiple days may never have been about undermining capitalism, but when she believes in networks of survival more than in a $20 bill, she does just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people might claim that my mother has no idea how systems of oppression work. Some might also claim that her focus on survival means she has internalized the system’s logic so that she oppresses herself. But get this: my mom has a different—but extremely deep—understanding of how systems of oppression work. She interacts with them daily, fighting to survive despite structural disadvantages. Working class laborers don’t need a physician to know that they&amp;#8217;re straining their bodies or an economist to know that they’re being exploited. Most of the time they don’t even need organizers writing articles about “the struggle” to know that it’s there and it’s theirs. The lived experience of these oppressions is not only real, it’s indispensable. No movement is legitimate without it. We don’t do justice to mothers like mine when we alienate them by privileging analytical understandings of systems of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like my mom is unaware of the theory. She just doesn’t deal in principles and structures; she speaks in persons and stories. She has a story for everything that theory describes because she knows what I know differently. One time while having a conversation about why she feels she has struggled so much financially, she told me that she must have been a really mean rich man in her past life because her life as a working class woman today is so difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom recognizes that there exists such a deep power imbalance between the rich and the poor, and that it has existed in all of the worlds she’s lived in. So while we never use the words “capitalism” or “class struggle” in our conversations, I can tell that in her core she has a sophisticated analysis of the world and knows that the world needs radical transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when I share this with her, first she is humbled and in disbelief about her greatness, and then she tells me that changing the world is my thing and she’s got hers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea—that we could have different valid ways of articulating systems of oppression and acting to fight them—led me to cultural, and ultimately, “intergenerational organizing.” Cultural organizing recognizes that facets of every day life, like cooking, dancing, and playing music, are legitimate forms of expression and accessible things to organize around. This helps people coming from different places with different conceptions of “the system” share in a common experience that allows a wide range of folks to contribute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is crucial in intergenerational organizing, since often old and young folks feel so separate. This is especially true when it comes to activism because it demands non-hierarchal power structures, whereas most adults and young people are used to a parent-child power relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is possible to use shared stories and culture to organize with people of all ages and be part of the same movement. I first learned about this at a Civil Rights Conference for young people. It offered me space to learn about the history of the Civil Rights Movement and how it helped us realized that at the core, our experiences with bullying and conflict were indicative of longer-term oppressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it’s not like that Civil Rights Conference. Sometimes young folks are not recognized for what they are capable of doing, even in spaces we are told are for us. When I feel the heaviness of being shut out of any space—social justice centered or not—I remember the relationship I have with my mom and I bask in the deep legacies and histories of her own survival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those situations, I can’t help but think about when my mom is considered too out of touch with the times to offer ideas, too inexperienced to create actions, and too lacking in potential to contribute to a movement. I know if all of those things are untrue when applied to my mother, then they are untrue when applied to me and other youth activists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/86bef86ea28397dc86b677abcb5e2cf0/tumblr_inline_mmpfwdKvVV1qz4rgp.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s crucial to understand why intergenerational organizing can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my mother and I share a lot in common, the difference between my mom’s experience and mine emerges when I recognize that I receive opportunities to make organizing a pillar of my struggle and survival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commit to cultural organizing in recognition of the fact that my mother does none of the logistical work that I do, but she has and continues to house my comrades, feed revolutionaries, and utilize her sewing skills to make sure we are cool in our summer marches and warm in our winter actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes her a part of my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She fills in some of the gaps we can’t fill and she does it as a part of her daily grind. With my mother, I am committing to intergenerational organizing by honoring our generational differences and experiences while simultaneously dispelling myths about age being a tool to measure skill level, drive, and wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom’s resistance and survival helps me to acknowledge the value of all types of skills that are brought to liberation work. She also helps me reject systems of measuring engagement that determine what qualifies as “enough” experience and credibility, which often replicates oppressions that operate in our daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we believe in the power of cultural and intergenerational organizing, the skills we bring to the movement nurture the beauty of our deep connections to one another that transcend age and generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night of my first TV appearance, I watched the 7&amp;#160;o’clock news next to mother. I was a little wounded because I wished that my mom had actually been there with me. But I realized that her absence wasn’t about lack of support or lack of belief in my visions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after having seen me in the news, my mom was driving me in the early hours of the morning to the airport so I could catch a plane for yet another conference. Halfway there, my mom turned and said to me in Vietnamese, “I believe in you 110%. I believe that everything you’re doing is right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course she does. I’m a part of &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; movement, aren’t I?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/4faf395b3dc74edf72edc7aa9d53c639/tumblr_inline_mmk16hnndZ1qz4rgp.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;I believe in {young}ist because there is no other online space that proposes the level of critical engagement, critique, and progressive lifestyle within the current youth culture, that {young}ist does.&amp;#8221; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;- Saar Shemesh, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;{young}ist art contributor, student organizer (&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ent from the occupation of Cooper Union&amp;#8217;s President’s Office, pictured above)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get ready for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/youngistdotorg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;{young}ist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the first and only site wholly devoted to storytelling, artistic projects, and fast-paced analysis of political &amp;amp;; cultural news from a team of staff and contributors aged 25 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is we need &lt;em&gt;{young}ist&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8212; now, more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young people across the globe have grown up amidst extreme economic, political, and ecological crises. Nevertheless, 79% of Millennials say they believe our generation has better opportunities to produce real structural change than any generation before us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Those under 25-years old, the first generation of Internet natives, make up half the world’s population.&lt;/strong&gt; So, it’s no surprise that young people have been at the forefront of nearly every recent social movement – from the Arab Sprint to Occupy Wall Street – pioneering strategies that bridge new media savvy and traditional face-to-face organizing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, no major online publications are run by and for young people. Few spaces exist dedicated to cultivating and amplifying the voices of young artists, journalists, and organizers across these emerging global youth movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this is a problem. It’s high-time time we had our own space – &lt;em&gt;a space where we can speak for ourselves&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;And that’s where &lt;a href=&quot;http://youngist.tumblr.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;{young}ist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes in &amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve already gathered an incredible team of 20 contributors from across the globe: the youngest DJ ever to score a major network TV show; a student anti-austerity activist from London; the blogger behind The Nation’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/blog/172303/dispatches-us-student-movement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dispatches from the US Student Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Connecticut; an undocumented youth activist and member of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fightbacknews.org/2011/4/7/8-undocumented-youth-arrested-georgia-hundreds-march-protest-education-ban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Georgia 8”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; a leading organizer behind the first-ever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NationalStudentPowerConvergence2013&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Student Power Convergence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Ohio; a political artist from Mexico City who was an organizer/trainer in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yosoy132media.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#YoSoy132 movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; a journalist and VICE magazine contributor from Pakistan … you get the idea, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youngist.tumblr.com/who-we-are&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cool people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, these folks are prepping everything from an advice column on how to survive a job at a nonprofit as a young person, to a poetic inside-look at LGBTQ leadership in the migrant justice movement, to a prescription for building US student power through real student unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming weeks, we’ll be launching this project’s Kickstarter campaign while working with some talented web developers to build the full site. In the meantime, we’ll begin publishing original content from the {young}ist team &lt;a href=&quot;http://youngist.tumblr.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;right here on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; — getting you the news you want, the way you want it, and looking damn good doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Stevens, {young}ist Engagement Editor, and the rest of us &lt;/p&gt;
